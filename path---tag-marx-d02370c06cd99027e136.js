As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors.\nAfter thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted.\nThis talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos. I will give insights into how companies can still stay relevant even when software is free - and I will do this by looking at how windmills utterly disrupted landowners in 11th century Yorkshire.",meta:{duration:"PT46M33S"},presenter:{name:"Jamie Dobson"},source:{id:"QgrChOltYek",provider:"youtube"},slug:"postcapitalism-jamie-dobson",tag:["GOTO Conference","Capitalism","Marx"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Postcapitalism"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"marx",tag:"Marx"}}}});
