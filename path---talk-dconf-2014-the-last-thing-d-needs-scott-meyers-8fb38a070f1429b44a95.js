For Scott Meyers, it’s all about interface design. That includes user interfaces, of course, but also APIs, i.e., class interfaces, function interfaces, template interfaces, etc. The guideline is simple: make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly, but achieving it can be challenging. In this presentation, Scott describes a number of specific ways to approach the design of high-quality interfaces. Much of the material is language- and domain-independent, but some of the ideas assume that you’re using a programming language with relatively strong static typing (e.g., C, C++, Java, C#).",meta:{duration:"PT58M42S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"5tg1ONG18H8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"scott-meyers-the-most-important-design-guideline",tag:["Application Programming Interface (Literature Subject)","Scott Meyers","C++"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5tg1ONG18H8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Scott Meyers – The Most Important Design Guideline"}},{node:{description:"The D Programming Language Conference, May 21-23 2014, Menlo Park, CA.",meta:{duration:"PT48M37S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"AhR4PSExnqk",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-sdc-a-d-compiler-as-a-library-by-amaury-sechet",tag:["D programming language","programming languages","programming","dconf","dlang"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AhR4PSExnqk/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014: SDC, a D Compiler as a Library by Amaury Sechet"}},{node:{description:"Higgs, a JIT compiler for JavaScript written in D, was presented at DConf 2013. Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining. We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in the Higgs implementation.",meta:{duration:"PT43M57S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"FGgFMZhnXvU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-day-2-talk-2-refactoring-jit-compilation-by-maxime-chevalier-boisvert",tag:["Compiler (Software Genre)","Just In Time","optimization","javascript","compilation","jit","dconf","higgs","conference","talk","Just-in-time Compilation"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGgFMZhnXvU/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014 Day 2 Talk 2: Refactoring JIT Compilation by Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert"}},{node:{description:"http://dconf.org/2014/talks/bright.html",meta:{duration:"PT58M52S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"eh8WETRT7q4",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-high-performance-code-using-d-walter-bright",tag:["dconf","dconf2014","dlang"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eh8WETRT7q4/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014: High Performance Code Using D (Walter Bright)"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"dconf-2014-the-last-thing-d-needs-scott-meyers",tags:["Scott Meyers","dlang","dconf","dconf2014"]}}}});
