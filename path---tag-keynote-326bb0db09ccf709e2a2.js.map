We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design. It also leads to code with potentially unwanted emergent properties. Today, we know how to create programs that can create programming languages.

But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H7M3S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"Kevlin Henney\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"B3b4tremI5o\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"small-is-beautiful\",\"tag\":[\"GOTO Conference\",\"Keynote\",\"GOTO Copenhagen\",\"Scaling\",\"Legacy System\",\"Simplicity\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Small Is Beautiful\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Aaron Swartz keynote - \\\"How we stopped SOPA\\\"  at F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012, Washington DC on May 21 2012.\\n\\nhttp://freedom-to-connect.net/\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT22M52S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"Aaron Swartz\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"Fgh2dFngFsg\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"f2c2012-aaron-swartz-keynote-how-we-stopped-sopa\",\"tag\":[\"SOPA\",\"freedom to connect\",\"internet freedom\",\"Keynote\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fgh2dFngFsg/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"\\\"How we stopped SOPA\\\"\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Our increasingly complex needs have led us to build increasing complex software. We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design. It also leads to code with potentially unwanted emergent properties. Today, we know how to create programs that can create programming languages. So why not write software that closely follows the problem, without a programming language, then let other programs create the programming language to support it? If we apply this rethinking to the design process, both problems and solutions can be thought of in terms of relational str\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H7M19S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"Alan Kay\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"QboI_1WJUlM\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"rethinking-design-risk-and-software\",\"tag\":[\"Inspiring\",\"Keynote\",\"COFES 2012\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QboI_1WJUlM/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Rethinking Design, Risk, and Software\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"In the 45+ years since Scott Meyers wrote his first program, he’s played many roles: programmer, user, educator, researcher, consultant.
