It has the speed and safety of a statically-typed language and the lightweight feel of a scripting language. It has a simple feature set that is easy to understand and powerful to use, including a novel type system and concurrent programming primitives. This talk will dive into some real-world Go programs and discuss the Go idiom used in each.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development.
