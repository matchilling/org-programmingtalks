Jobs shares his professional vision and personal anecdotes, from his role at the time as president and CEO of NeXT Computer Corporation, to the thrilling challenges of co-creating Apple Computer, and subsequent disappointments at his ousting. In conversational exchanges with audience members Jobs underscores the value of direct experience in the field, and “developing scar tissue.” The unexpected guest lecture within the Sloan Distinguished Speaker Series came about through the efforts of a Sloan MBA ’92 student whose sister had recently married Jobs.\n\n(Special Thanks to Youtuber Paul Mangione for linking out these highlights!)\nHighlights   \n   5:13 Comparing management vs. operational productivity in software\n   9:25 Rapid development of application software using NeXT\n  10:30 Desktop publishing on the Macintosh\n  15:25 Problems with consultants \n  18:03 Should NeXT just become a software company\n  24:38 Who are NeXT\'s competitors, Sun Solaris, Microsoft NT, Taligent\n  27:41 NeXTSTEP operating environment, "the code that never breaks is the code that you don\'t \n        write...so write less code", benefits of object-oriented programming\n  30:59 NEXT\'s growth dependent on application developers\n  33:25 reflecting on separating from Apple and the struggles at Apple focusing on consumer electronics\n  37:27 Big achievements and management organization at NEXT\n  41:45 How technology windows open in the market, Apple II, DOS, Lisa, Macintosh, NeXT Cube, \n        "I think object-oriented technology is the biggest technical breakthrough I have seen since \n        the early 80\'s with graphical user interfaces and I think it\'s bigger actually."\n  46:40 Should you develop applications or objects and tools, "the brightest people are writing objects"\n  48:23 Developing products with higher education, Project Athena\n  51:22 What I Learned at Apple, taking a longer-term view on people\n  53:01 Management style and resolving conflict\n  56:18 Macintosh and PC and challenges with portability, processor speed, disk space, high speed \n        networking, true color displays, power\n  58:45 Manufacturing systems Macintosh vs. NeXT, removing warehouses with Just in Time processes, \n        factories as software with interesting I/O devices (robots)\n1:06:11 Using manufacturing to improve time to market, product and process simultaneously\n1:11:57 Growth of Apple and the Macintosh market\n\n\nPlease Subscribe for more great content!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/MITVideoProductions?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWe tell stories that inspire, enrich, and improve lives.

Turing Centenary Celebration, June, 2012.\n\nAbstract:\n\nA very fast development in the early 1930s, following Hilbert's codification of Mathematical Logic, led to the Incompleteness Theorems, Computable Functions, Undecidability Theorems, and the general formulation of recursive Function Theory. The so-called Lambda Calculus played a key role. The history of these developments will be traced, and the much later place of Lambda Calculus in Mathematics and Programming-Language Theory will be outlined.",meta:{duration:"PT30M8S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"SphBW9ILVPU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"lambda-calculus-then-and-now",tag:["Calculus","Dana S.
