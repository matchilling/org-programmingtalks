Lately, we are seeing an explosion in JVM languages. This is partly, but not only, because of Java 7, the first JVM to ship with invokedynamic, which is a quantum leap in polyglot runtime implementation. This session explains why emerging language implementations are becoming more common and more feasible to implement on the JVM with satisfactory performance. It tells you how we got there and walks through the technology already in place (such as invokedynamic) and that which is in progress. The future for the JVM is bright indeed.
