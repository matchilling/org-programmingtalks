Not just the basics like valgrind, talloc and the Jenkins hash, but less sane techniques like typesafe callbacks, runtime code updating, C as a scripting language and malloc failure path testing.\r\n\r\nEveryone who codes in C will get something out of this talk.\n\nhttp://2011.linux.conf.au/ - http://www.linux.org.au\nCC BY-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt",meta:{duration:"PT46M53S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BEQ3sRakIs0",provider:"youtube"},slug:"advanced-c-coding-for-fun",tag:["LCA2011","Linux","Open Source"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Advanced C Coding For Fun!"}},{node:{description:'Barbara Liskov, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discusses "Programming the Turing Machine" in a lecture given on the occasion of Princeton University\'s centennial celebration of Alan Turing.
