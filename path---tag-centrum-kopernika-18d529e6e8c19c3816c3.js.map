Roughly speaking, the ontology in the sense of Quine does not aspire to establish what does exist, but rather what a given theory or doctrine assumes there exists.

Only those entities that correspond to such variables are postulated to exist. However, in principle each topos has its own \\\"internal logic\\\". Consequently, we should apply Quine's program to each such category individually (by employing its own internal logic), and speak about the ontology in the sense of Quine characteristic for a given category in terms of a given logical calculus (if Quine's program is realisable in this logic). However, the Quine ontological program does not directly refer to the internal logic of a given theory, but rather to the logic with the help of which we are interpreting this theory (the external or meta-logic), and this is expected to be the standard classical logic. This is also the case with respect to category theory. When developing this theory, for instance by proving theorems, we are using standard logical laws of inference. This is why we seem entitled to ontologically interpret category theory strictly following Quine's recipe (i.e. with the help of the first order logical calculus), but we should be aware that this could be conditioned by the fact that our brain is a macroscopic object embedded into the world having the ontology characteristic for the category of sets.
