Programmers and software engineers seldom do. A blueprint for software is called a specification. The need for extremely rigorous specifications before coding complex or critical systems should be obvious—especially for concurrent and distributed systems. This talk explains why some sort of specification should be written for any software. http://www.microsoftfacultysummit.com</p></div></li><li id="talk_f12111fe-6c20-4350-af1e-7c2fc1ecc38f" data-talk-source-id="-6BsiVyC1kM" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">The Value of Values</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Rich Hickey</span><span class="duration">32 minutes</span><span class="tag">JaxConf 2012</span><span class="tag">Keynote</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-6BsiVyC1kM/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-6BsiVyC1kM/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data.

However, models and inference algorithms can be difficult to specify and implement, let alone design, validate, or optimize. Additionally, inference often appears to be intractable. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field that aims to address these challenges by formalizing modeling and inference using key ideas from probability theory, programming languages, and Turing-universal computation. This talk will illustrate the common underlying principles of probabilistic programming using three research platforms: BayesDB, a Bayesian database that enables users to directly query the probable implications of data tables without training in statistics. It provides BQL, an SQL-like language for Bayesian data analysis, and MML, a minimal language for building generative population models by combining automatic model-building techniques with qualitative constraints and custom statistical code. BayesDB has been applied to problems such as cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites and assessing the evidence for microbial biomarkers of Kwashiorkor, a form of severe malnutrition. Picture, an imperative probabilistic language for 3D scene perception. Picture uses deep neural networks and statistical learning to invert generative models based on computer graphics. 50-line Picture programs can infer 3D models of human poses, faces, and other object classes from single images. Venture, an integrated platform that aims to be sufficiently expressive, efficient, and extensible for general-purpose use. It provides VentureScript, a language that gives users fine-grained control over both modeling and inference, and defines a common interface for integrating components written in other probabilistic languages. Recent applications include structure discovery from time-series via Gaussian processes and reflective AI techniques such as Bayesian optimization. Vikash K.

We can ensure fewer mistakes enter our code base with immutability by default, no concept of null, and proven memory safety. Rust's state of the art compiler helps developers catch errors as early as possible without paying a penalty at runtime. Developers can write high level code in a modern language without sacrificing expressiveness, development time, or execution speed. We will explore how Rust's concept of Ownership is the key to providing compile-time safety. These guarantees apply even in the face of concurrency, allowing you to easily write multi-threaded programs correctly the first time. Rust 1.0 was released May 15th.

Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon. But how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples. I use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture. Developing a &quot;modern style,&quot; however, is essential if we don't want to maintain newly-written 1970s and 1980s style code in 2020. This presentation reflects my thoughts on what &quot;Modern C++&quot; should mean in the 2010s: a language for programming based on light-weight abstraction with direct and efficient mapping to hardware, suitable for infrastructure code.</p></div></li><li id="talk_53a32c23-45fc-4fb7-b800-e0f47750cd26" data-talk-source-id="0oTh1CXRaQ0" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">David Beazley - Modules and Packages: Live and Let Die! - PyCon 2015</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">3 hours</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0oTh1CXRaQ0/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0oTh1CXRaQ0/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">&quot;Speaker: David Beazley All Python programmers use the import statement, but do you really know how it works and what it allows?

Imagine booting to the BEAM VM in just a few seconds with your Elixir app in control of the entire system. Nerves makes this possible while replacing the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files with a toolchain that is delightful to use. The Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at start-up time: Elixir. Together, we'll explore the principles Nerves uses to create embedded systems that control 3d printers, power unmanned areal vehicles, and more. You'll see first-hand how Nerves can support service discovery, hot code swapping, and collaboration through PubSub messages and mesh networking. Finally, we will explore the Nerves development life-cycle; from running ExTest, to deployment and hot code reloading. Talk objectives * Introduce developing embedded systems in Elixir using Nerves * Explore the Nerves development life-cycle * Demonstrate autonomous robotics using service discovery and messaging * Execute tests, create user interfaces with Phoenix, and perform hot code updates Target audience Creating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature. The exploration into creating hardware that runs Elixir is geared toward the maker in all of us. Join us for an exciting demonstration into the creation of enhanced embedded systems with Elixir and Nerves. Justin started his career as a recording engineer spanning several years in the early 2000’s. He transitioned to programming C++ apps in the public sector of local government in 2005 and eventually came to master iOS development while working for an interactive marketing company. During this time, he gained a passion for embedded systems, sparked from his love of riding motorcycles. Over the years, Justin has worked on a plethora of embedded projects from iPhone motorcycle starters to advanced brewing and distilling equipment. Recently, Justin founded Metasphere, an embedded software company primarily focused on building Bakeware and Nerves.

Yet we still frequently encounter situations where extracting a value from a map is not guaranteed to succeed, or mapping across a set of cases is not guaranteed to be exhaustive. With dependent types we can make operations like these completely safe by construction, in the process eliminating entire classes of errors, and furthermore we can do this without complicating user code. Additionally, with more precise type information becoming available at compile time, we elicit the exciting opportunity to use it to optimize performance at runtime, beyond what would be possible without dependent typing. The talk will cover several simple and intermediate examples using dependent types, and will give a brief outline of some of the the challenges involved in implementing typesafe libraries with dependent types in Scala, but the majority of the talk will be accessible to all Scala users.</p></div></li><li id="talk_eeada61d-5368-4df5-9533-094a984af31d" data-talk-source-id="2PJ_DbKGFUA" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Philip Wadler: Church's Coincidences</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Philip Wadler</span><span class="tag">University of Edinburgh</span><span class="tag">Princeton</span><span class="tag">Alan Turing</span><span class="tag">computer science</span><span class="tag">lambda calculus</span><span class="tag">Turing machine</span><span class="tag">#turingprinceton</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PJ_DbKGFUA/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2PJ_DbKGFUA/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Philip Wadler, Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, contends that the foundations of computing lay in a coincidence: Church's lambda calculus (1933), Herbrand and Godel's recursive functions (1934), and Turing's machines (1935) all defined the same model of computation.

It can be used for any conceivable application - not just telecom. It has a multi-decade track record of success. So why does it remain a niche technology? To answer this question, Garrett turned to science. He conducted a detailed survey across a wide spectrum of programmers, architects, and managers to gather data on this question. In this talk, Garrett will present his findings and reflect on what they could mean for Erlang and its community. Erlang adoption is important. It makes your job easier when Erlang is supported by your company and customers. It's easier to grow teams when there are more Erlang programmers. The language itself will improve as it is applied across more domains. If you're interested in this topic - and want data rather than personal opinions - join Garrett in this important discussion. Talk objectives: - To present data to better understand how Erlang is used and, more importantly, how and why Erlang is not used. Target audience: - Anyone interested in supporting and promoting Erlang adoption, either within their company or within the broader programming community.</p></div></li><li id="talk_03edc789-d6e8-488f-b27e-0a116b972d91" data-talk-source-id="3SdSKZFoUa8" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">CppCon 2014: Mark Maimone &quot;C++ on Mars: Incorporating C++ into Mars Rover Flight Software&quot;</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">C++ on Mars: Incorporating C++ into Mars Rover Flight Software</span><span class="tag">Mark Maimone</span><span class="tag">CppCon 2014</span><span class="tag">Computer Science (Field of Study)</span><span class="tag">Bash Films</span><span class="tag">Conference Video Recording</span><span class="tag">Event Video Recording</span><span class="tag">Video Conferencing</span><span class="tag">video conferencing equipment</span><span class="tag">videoconference</span><span class="tag">video services</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3SdSKZFoUa8/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3SdSKZFoUa8/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">http://www.cppcon.org -- Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014 -- One of the more challenging aspects of developing flight software (FSW) for NASA's Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover was how to enable them to drive themselves safely through unknown Martian terrain. When the MER mission was approved in the year 2000, JPL researchers had already demonstrated that capability on prototype rovers [1] using software written primarily in C++ on a VxWorks realtime O/S platform with shared memory. So when asked to incorporate that capability into the MER vehicles which also relied on a similar VxWorks realtime O/S, the team concluded it would be safest and most expedient to incorporate the already field-tested C++ software. But that presented a challenge, since at that point all rover FSW development was mandated to be done mainly in the C programming language. In this talk we present some of the challenges we faced and solutions we found in deploying C++ onto the Mars Rovers. For example, dynamic allocation was initially precluded, but development of a specialized memory allocator (using the C++ &quot;placement new&quot; operator) enabled us to incorporate it safely into the flight system. We will discuss what aspects of C++ were incorporated, what simulation environments aided development, describe some of the tools used to validate system behavior, and explain how our success using C++ for the implementation of autonomous navigation on MER has influenced future FSW efforts.

Traditional software concurrency management leads to non-deterministic race conditions and deadlocks that are hard to reproduce and debug, leading to unreliable software. That means it's time to introduce math. Tony Hoare's paradigm of communicating sequential processes, or CSP, is not only a robust way to manage concurrency, but it's fun too! Join us to learn more about how CSP in the Go programming language allows us to reason more clearly about many things happening at once.

Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols? The answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their &quot;good&quot;, expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness. The designers' desire for more functionality has made these protocols effectively unsecurable. In this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0-days, and will show where to look for these 0-days. We will also discuss simple principles of how to avoid designing such protocols.</p></div></li><li id="talk_3ec4d904-7e43-46f5-8a97-e6b659cd2e9b" data-talk-source-id="3oQTSP4FngY" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Zach Tellman - Always Be Composing</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">35 minutes</span><span class="tag">clojure</span><span class="tag">abstraction</span><span class="tag">Functional Programming (Programming Language Paradigm)</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3oQTSP4FngY/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3oQTSP4FngY/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">The Clojure ecosystem, we're told, is made up of small, composable libraries. In practice, though, it's all too common to find that two libraries simply will not cleanly compose. This typically will lead to another library that does the same thing, but in a subtly different way. Sometimes this is warranted, but often it's not. This talk will discuss the constraints and affordances that make a piece of code play nicely with other pieces of code. Attendees will learn how to write clean, reusable Clojure, drawing on the speaker's many past failures and few notable successes. The first place I think of, when I try to tell someone about this quality, is a corner of an English country garden, where Zach Tellman grows against a wall. The wall runs east to west; Zach grows flat against its southern side. The sun shines on him and as it warms the bricks behind Zach, the warm bricks themselves warms the peaches on him. It has a slightly dozy quality. Zach, carefully tied to grow flat against the wall; warming the bricks; the peaches growing in the sun; the wild grass growing around Zach's roots, in the angle where the earth and roots and wall all meet.</p></div></li><li id="talk_adb3b776-635c-4d00-bb15-fd4bb4fb8652" data-talk-source-id="3v03NFcyvzc" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">&quot;Haste: Full-Stack Haskell for Non-PhD Candidates&quot; by Erin Swenson-Healey and James Cooper</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">41 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3v03NFcyvzc/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3v03NFcyvzc/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description"></p></div></li><li id="talk_f655ae79-a265-4fe7-904b-5ea202e686ca" data-talk-source-id="3v75aX5-gSA" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">&quot;No, Really...

We'll talk about what JavaScript-enabled robots can already do, what they can't do yet, and what they might be able to do with a bit of elbow grease.

For Scott Meyers, it’s all about interface design. That includes user interfaces, of course, but also APIs, i.e., class interfaces, function interfaces, template interfaces, etc. The guideline is simple: make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly, but achieving it can be challenging. In this presentation, Scott describes a number of specific ways to approach the design of high-quality interfaces. Much of the material is language- and domain-independent, but some of the ideas assume that you’re using a programming language with relatively strong static typing (e.g., C, C++, Java, C#).</p></div></li><li id="talk_519157d1-fd56-4fc3-9ba9-ed09f2989a80" data-talk-source-id="60P7717-XOQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Computing a theory of everything</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Stephen Wolfram</span><span class="duration">21 minutes</span><span class="tag">TEDTalks</span><span class="tag">Physics</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60P7717-XOQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/60P7717-XOQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Stephen Wolfram, creator of Mathematica, talks about his quest to make all knowledge computational -- able to be searched, processed and manipulated.

Most problematic is that this approach keeps us from composing core algorithms in a context-independent way which would facilitate reuse and engender greater flexibility. This talk will describe transducers, a new library feature for Clojure (but of interest to other languages) that emphasizes composable, context-free, intermediate-free notions like 'mapping' and 'filtering' and their concrete reuse across all of the contexts above.</p></div></li><li id="talk_98fb0c5e-12fd-4787-8ff6-68832c12df44" data-talk-source-id="72sWgwaAoyk" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">[JSConfUS 2013] Adam Solove: Constraint programming in the browser</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">28 minutes</span><span class="tag">constraint programming</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72sWgwaAoyk/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72sWgwaAoyk/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Slides: https://github.com/asolove/jsconf-2013-slides Description: Constraint programming is a paradigm that lets programmers specify the relationships between different variables, and then maintain those relationships even as the user toys with each variable.

I had no idea when I started learning these arcane (guess how the &quot;dd&quot; command got its name) and cryptic (what about &quot;grep&quot;?) Unix commands how incredibly useful they would become over the next two decades. If your primary OS is Linux or OSX on the desktop, and maybe iOS or Android on the move, you'll find this 40-something year joke (&quot;Unix&quot; itself was a bad pun) has managed to embed itself into every facet of your technological life. Being comfortable at a shell prompt and having a healthy working knowledge of Unix commands and regular expressions will give you a whole new level of capability.

By compiling the PyPy interpreter into javascript, and retargeting its JIT compiler to emit asmjs code at runtime, it is possible to run python code in the browser at speeds competitive with a native python environment. This talk will demonstrate the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the results that have been achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when trying to take python onto javascript's home turf. We'll cover: an overview of PyPy and why it's a good fit for this type of project; an introduction to asmjs and the rise of javascript as a compile target; what it looks like when you smoosh these two technologies together; a comparison with other approaches such as brython; and some concrete suggestions for how the result might be useful in practice.

We say things like “don’t block the event loop”, “make sure your code runs at 60 frames-per-second”, “well of course, it won’t work, that function is an asynchronous callback!” If you’re anything like me, you nod and agree, as if it’s all obvious, even though you don’t actually know what the words mean; and yet, finding good explanations of how JavaScript actually works isn’t all that easy, so let’s learn! With some handy visualisations, and fun hacks, let’s get an intuitive understanding of what happens when JavaScript runs.

Adherents of competing paradigms, such as functional and object-oriented programming, often appear motivated by faith. Families of related languages, such as C, C++, Java, and C#, may arise from pressures of evolution. As designers of languages, adoption rates provide us with scientific data, but the belief that elegant designs are better is a matter of faith. This talk traces one concept, second-order quantification, from its inception in the symbolic logic of Frege through to the generic features introduced in Java 5, touching on features of faith and evolution. The remarkable correspondence between natural deduction and functional programming informed the design of type classes in Haskell. Generics in Java evolved directly from Haskell type classes, and are designed to support evolution from legacy code to generic code. Links, a successor to Haskell aimed at AJAX-style three-tier web applications, aims to reconcile some of the conflict between dynamic and static approaches to typing.

All of the slides are available at: http://worrydream.com/dbx/ For his recent DBX Conference talk, Victor took attendees back to the year 1973, donning the uniform of an IBM systems engineer of the times, delivering his presentation on an overhead projector. The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: &quot;We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.&quot; And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'&quot;</p></div></li><li id="talk_75f64f53-cf77-4c07-9020-4a6fe4eeabd4" data-talk-source-id="9-u2n4GgcVw" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Rishiyur S.

But finite state machines (FSMs) have real, practical value, and it is useful to know how to build and apply them in Clojure. For example, FSMs have long been popular to model game AIs and workflow rules, and FSMs provide the behind-the-scenes magic that powers Java's regexes and core.async's go blocks. In this talk, we'll look at two programming puzzles that, suprisingly, have very elegant solutions when looked at through the lens of FSMs, with code demonstrations using two different Clojure libraries for automata (automat and reduce-fsm), as well as loco, a Clojure constraint solver. About the speakers: Mark Engelberg has been an active member of the Clojure community ever since Clojure turned 1.0, and is the primary developer of math.combinatorics, math.numeric-tower, data.priority-map, ubergraph, and a co-developer of instaparse. By day, he teaches Scheme and Clojure to talented kids in the Seattle area; by night, he creates logic puzzles and games, using Clojure as his &quot;secret weapon&quot;. His latest game is Code Master, a programming-themed puzzle game for kids, available exclusively at Target (and created with Clojure, of course!) Alex Engelberg was indoctrinated by his father in the ways of functional programming at a young age, and Clojure rapidly became his language of choice. He is happy to be using Clojure professionally as a software engineer at SecureOne in Seattle. Alex also enjoys contributing to open source; he is the primary developer of loco, and co-developer of instaparse.</p></div></li><li id="talk_4fb142ac-4c0e-4089-aca8-f220d07f5ca5" data-talk-source-id="AKtHxKJRwp4" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Don't Help the Compiler</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">c++</span><span class="tag">goingnative</span><span class="tag">goingnative 2013</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AKtHxKJRwp4/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AKtHxKJRwp4/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Day 1 - C++ has powerful rules for dealing with low-level program structure. Before a program is ever executed, the compiler determines valuable information about every expression in the source code. The compiler understands exactly how long each object's resources will be needed (lifetime), whether each expression refers to an object that the program has no other way of accessing (rvalueness), and what operations can be performed on each object (type). Using examples from C++98 through C++14, this presentation will demonstrate how to write code that works with the compiler's knowledge to increase robustness, efficiency, and clarity. This presentation will also demonstrate the horrible things that happen when programmers think they can do tasks that are better left to compilers.</p></div></li><li id="talk_98f16717-ab52-4e40-849d-f72c67c89ff4" data-talk-source-id="AXlp7qxqu8E" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Thomas Pfaff: Advanced Data Storage</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">pydata</span><span class="tag">Berlin</span><span class="tag">Python</span><span class="tag">programming language</span><span class="tag">lecture</span><span class="tag">science</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AXlp7qxqu8E/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AXlp7qxqu8E/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">In this tutorial we will give an introduction to two advanced data storage formats.

He'll be talking about Clojure, Communicating Sequential Processes &amp; Responsive Design. This talk was recorded at the NY Clojure Users Group meetup at Two Sigma Investments. As clients diversify on all fronts, how do we program flexible user interfaces without getting mired in software bloat and rampant complexity? Communicating Sequential Processes gives us the tools we need to design modular user interface components - we'll see how with Clojure, ClojureScript and core.async.

Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations. While there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.</p></div></li><li id="talk_09736179-2ec3-4b7b-ad26-5bf6a39d3220" data-talk-source-id="BEQ3sRakIs0" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Advanced C Coding For Fun!</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">LCA2011</span><span class="tag">Linux</span><span class="tag">Open Source</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Presenter(s): Rusty Russell URL: http://2011.linux.conf.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/190 While working on CCAN I realised just how many C coding tricks there are.

Sometimes the best library design is based on a pattern that's very familiar to a Haskell programmer but alien to a C++ programmer. The new std::future proposal for C++17 hides several functional patterns including that of a monad -- the boogeyman of generations of imperative programmers. But once seen in action, the monad becomes just one more pattern in the toolbox of a library designer. Bio Bartosz Milewski always tries to be where the action is. He started as a quantum physicist when supertstrings were hot, joined the software industry to build the search engine for Microsoft Windows, became an avid proponent of object-oriented programming, and wrote a book on C++. He got into concurrency and parallelism when the multicores hit the market, and now he's evangelizing functional programming as the Holy Grail of software development.</p></div></li><li id="talk_57c8178e-a505-4eb4-a984-5cbd67b008c1" data-talk-source-id="BdjcPgIUbnA" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">JVMLS 2015 - VM Design Choices</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Java</span><span class="tag">JVM</span><span class="tag">JVMLS</span><span class="tag">JVM Language Summit</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdjcPgIUbnA/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BdjcPgIUbnA/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">JVMLS 2015 - VM Design Choices - Cliff Click The JVM Language Summit is an open technical collaboration among language designers, compiler writers, tool builders, runtime engineers, and VM architects.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured &quot;Big Data&quot; analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.

By making your code express your intent, using the power of new language and library functionality, and leaving hard-to-read constructs out of your vocabulary, you can give your code a makeover that will stand the test of time. -- James McNellis is a senior engineer on the Microsoft Visual C++ team, where he is responsible for the Visual C++ C Runtime (CRT) and C Standard Library implementation.

Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website. Once again - thank you all for creating the first edition of Atmosphere Conference and see you next year.</p></div></li><li id="talk_c162e2c6-55f5-41b4-9749-50ad846f0b78" data-talk-source-id="C5fa1LZYodQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Is Node.js Better?</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Brian Ford</span><span class="duration">42 minutes</span><span class="tag">JSConf US 2012</span><span class="tag">Node.js</span><span class="tag">Ruby On Rails</span><span class="tag">JavaScript</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5fa1LZYodQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5fa1LZYodQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">How do we resolve the question, &quot;is this better than that?&quot; This talk discusses ideas for improving how we handle conflict in the programming community through the lens of evaluating whether Node.js is better than other technologies like Ruby.</p></div></li><li id="talk_185f89a3-5308-443c-879a-17f4e65b06dc" data-talk-source-id="CQyt9Vlkbis" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Writing Quality Code in Erlang</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">41 minutes</span><span class="tag">erlang_factory</span><span class="tag">chicago_erlang_factory_lite_2014</span><span class="tag">GarrettSmith</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CQyt9Vlkbis/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CQyt9Vlkbis/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Garrett Smith http://www.chicagoerlang.com/garrett-smith.html We all know that one of Erlang's greatest weaknesses is its syntax.

In a lot of cases, these side-effects are practically a part of the public API -- they put restrictions the way the code can be used, often obscurely, and have effects that are observable to the caller. It helps a lot to acknowledge this and explicitly treat them as a part of your public API. Here are the basic ideas that I'll cover: represent your side-effects as &quot;intents to perform an action&quot; -- transparent objects that expose the details of the side-effect, without actually performing it combine effects with pure code to describe the execution order and data dependencies (yes, like a monad) write unit tests for your code without mocking, by specifying the expected content, results, and order of side-effects performed by a function I'll show a library implemented for Python, called Effect, that provides tools for doing this. A lot of these ideas are similar to the Extensible Effects system described for Haskell, and I'll describe some ideas and techniques that even most Haskellers could use to make their code more easily testable.

This talk is about the next level of knowledge: the things advanced developers know that let them turn good code into great. Code that's easy to read and a breeze to change. These topics will be covered solely by LIVE CODING; no slides. We'll boldly refactor right on stage, and pray the tests stay green. You might even learn some vim tricks as well as an expert user shows you his workflow. Topics include: The Open-Closed Principle The types of coupling, and their dangers Why composition is so damn great A powerful refactoring that Kent Beck refers to as &quot;deep deep magic&quot; How to destroy conditionals with a NullObject The beauty of the Decorator pattern Testing smells, including Mystery Guest and stubbing the system under test The stuff from the last halves of Refactoring and Clean Code that you never quite got to.</p></div></li><li id="talk_97afd765-a459-4aa2-b9e6-72d022aeff9a" data-talk-source-id="DE18fHyZ0GI" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">LambdaConf 2015 - Make Your Own Programming Language!

I'll give an overview of the pipeline from your text editor to the machine's behavior. Then, we'll dive in and look at specific tools that will help us create our own programming language.

We'll charge at high speed through the following topics, with Clojure code to follow along with as we go (because there's no better language for implementing a Lisp than another Lisp): * Parsing: turning text files into ASTs * Fundamental Lisp datatypes * McCarthy's elementary functions * Evaluating Lisp code * Lambdas and lexical scope * Your friend, the state monad * Beyond Lisp: pattern matching and type systems When we're done, you'll be ready to go forth and fill the world with Lisps of all shapes, colours and Greenspun violations for Great Justice.

As Object Oriented methodologies gained popularity, MVC too gained traction as a natural and logical way to construct user interfaces despite obvious shortcomings. Even though OO researchers moved forward with alternative approaches likes Morphic and constraint based systems, MVC today maintains a stranglehold on mainstream developer approaches to UI. Can functional programming take the good lessons from MVC while advancing the state of the art? Functional Reactive Programming and its derivatives primarily solve complexities around events - what of component modularity and abstraction? We'll examine how a new library for ClojureScript called Om, a simple functional layer over Facebook's React, makes some traditional hard problems in MVC based UIs simple without abandoning the abstractions OO programmers find so useful. These concepts are easily portable to other systems provided the presence of persistent data structures.</p></div></li><li id="talk_d7d4af9c-138f-4f59-840a-d031a79ca203" data-talk-source-id="DN4yLZB1vUQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Ashley Williams: If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">26 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DN4yLZB1vUQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DN4yLZB1vUQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Javascript has always been a language with very little syntactic sugar—for better or worse. With ES6/2015, and future iterations,though, Javascript is gaining a more and more abstract and expressive syntax. To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners— is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners. As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.</p></div></li><li id="talk_328a72f5-2625-4ad3-abd7-90dd168d9b94" data-talk-source-id="DqMFX91ToLw" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Netflix JavaScript Talks - Version 7: The Evolution of JavaScript</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">netflix</span><span class="tag">JavaScript (Programming Language)</span><span class="tag">reactive programming</span><span class="tag">Web Development (Interest)</span><span class="tag">netflix ui engineering</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqMFX91ToLw/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqMFX91ToLw/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Jafar Husain discusses interesting features that can be used today in JS6, such as Object.observe, async functions and async generators, while also giving a peek at what's being explored for JS7 to make async programming easier.</p></div></li><li id="talk_e07c7d75-818a-44ce-8dca-4b230ab025ab" data-talk-source-id="DspYurD75Ns" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">CODE GENIUS - Rise of the Transpilers by Jeremy Ashkenas</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">44 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DspYurD75Ns/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DspYurD75Ns/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">New York Times graphics editor, Jeremy Ashkenas, presents at Code Genius. 4/23/15 Follow Jeremy Ashkenas: @jashkenas www.ashkenas.com Visit code.genius.com for more information about past events and upcoming talks Presented by Genius GENIUS.COM</p></div></li><li id="talk_70c79cb1-5c08-44e2-810b-66d2671787b6" data-talk-source-id="E6RTBlO9TZQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">ElixirDaze 2016 - Keynote: New Heights by Chris McCord</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6RTBlO9TZQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6RTBlO9TZQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Keynote: New Heights by Chris McCord Help us caption &amp; translate this video! http://amara.org/v/IDIZ/</p></div></li><li id="talk_f7374719-5177-40a8-923b-05b6cad0b83d" data-talk-source-id="E8I19uA-wGY" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Functional programming design patterns by Scott Wlaschin</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Software Design Pattern (Field Of Study)</span><span class="tag">Functional Programming (Programming Language Paradigm)</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8I19uA-wGY/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8I19uA-wGY/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.

Learn the power of the Observable and how Netflix has simplified code through the ability to filter, aggregate, compose and project data streams. This talk discusses how Netflix uses Rx to: - Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag and drop) - Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests - Reactively update the UI in response to data changes - Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events - Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exceptions Slides: http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/1002549/Async-Javascript-at-Netflix-2014-03-19?pk=58d9-8985-be37-25f7-dc90-fe60-a9e2-03ab</p></div></li><li id="talk_5bd40719-76dc-4d2c-9374-694e4402f3bb" data-talk-source-id="FEs2jgZBaQA" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">CSS Performance Tooling</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Addy Osmani</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">CSSconf EU 2014</span><span class="tag">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FEs2jgZBaQA/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FEs2jgZBaQA/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">You've learned the concepts, now meet the tools. High-performance sites need to feel instant and deliver the goods in less than 1000ms. In this talk, learn about the bleeding edge tools that can automate keeping your CSS on the fast path. Automate generating critical-path CSS, removing unused CSS, discovering duplicate selectors, colors and more. Along the way, we might even optimize a well known conference site and send them a pull request to help keep the web fast. The tools we'll discuss can be used with Grunt, Gulp, Make or horse so strap yourself in and get ready for a ride into the crazier side of CSS performance optimization.

Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining. We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in the Higgs implementation.</p></div></li><li id="talk_30160d93-410e-463a-9ab2-f151d361aa0f" data-talk-source-id="FGrIyBDQLPg" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Miguel Grinberg: Flask by Example - PyCon 2014</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">4 hours</span><span class="tag">PyCon2014</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGrIyBDQLPg/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGrIyBDQLPg/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Speaker: Miguel Grinberg Flask is a web framework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.

Poor code, however, is rarely arbitrary and random in its structure or formulation. Systems of code, well or poorly structured, emerge from systems of practice, whether effective or ineffective. To improve code quality, it makes more sense to pick apart the specific practices and see their interplay — the cause — than to simply focus on the code itself — the effect. This talk looks at how a handful of coding habits, design practices and assumptions can systematically balloon code and compound its accidental complexity.</p></div></li><li id="talk_a16f6f30-50e0-4036-90ae-b4efa78abb8e" data-talk-source-id="G-lGCC4KKok" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Scalability at YouTube</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">39 minutes</span><span class="tag">psf</span><span class="tag">python pycon pycon2012</span><span class="tag">pycon_2012</span><span class="tag">Shannon-jjBehrens</span><span class="tag">MikeSolomon</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-lGCC4KKok/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/G-lGCC4KKok/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Shannon -jj Behrens, Mike Solomon This talk covers scalability at YouTube.

Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected. A single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness. In this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.

It has been applied to a wide range of problems spanning several areas of science, engineering, and the arts, in many cases equaling or exceeding human performance. Genetic programming's roots are in Lisp, making Clojure a natural choice for modern genetic programming research and development. In this talk I will show how a simple genetic programming system can be written in about 100 lines of Clojure code, how a mature genetic programming system (PushGP) implemented in Clojure can improve the state of the art in automatic programming, and how genetic programming can be incorporated into an artificial life environment implemented in Clojure and Quil. About the speaker: Lee Spector is a Professor of Computer Science in the School of Cognitive Science at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and an adjunct professor of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. His areas of teaching and research include genetic and evolutionary computation, quantum computation, and a variety of intersections between computer science, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and the arts. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines (published by Springer) and a member of the editorial board of Evolutionary Computation (published by MIT Press). He is also a member of the SIGEVO executive committee and he was named a Fellow of the International Society for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation.

At first sight it appears to be a simple coincidence---almost a pun---but it turns out to be remarkably robust, inspiring the design of theorem provers and programming languages, and continuing to influence the forefronts of computing. Propositions as Types has many names and many origins, and is a notion with depth, breadth, and mystery. Learn why functional programming is (and is not) the universal programming language.

Simon Peyton Jones wants children not just to consume technology, but to be creative with it. What does that mean for teaching computer science in schools, and why is the rest of the world watching England? Simon Peyton Jones is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. His research focus is in programming language design and implementation, and the purely-functional language Haskell in particular. He is a founder member and current chair of the Computing at School working group, which has played a central role in the recent reform of the school Computing curriculum. At TEDxExeter 2014 our speakers and performers connected us with other worlds. Our talks exposed corruption in big business, shared effective approaches to tackling social inequality and gave a voice to those whose human rights are under threat. We explored the impact of fast changing technologies on all our lives. We journeyed through fire and forest to frozen landscapes. We were challenged to consider worlds of extremes, cutting edge controversies and risky opportunities. https://twitter.com/simonpj0 Video Production Chromatrope (http://chromatrope.co.uk/) Production Manager Andy Robertson (http://www.youtube.com/familygamertv) About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</p></div></li><li id="talk_30248b9d-442f-460a-9c15-328f133f0ac4" data-talk-source-id="IessjPY9gwI" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Why Google Glass?</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Sergey Brin</span><span class="duration">7 minutes</span><span class="tag">TEDTalks</span><span class="tag">Design</span><span class="tag">User Interface</span><span class="tag">Google</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IessjPY9gwI/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IessjPY9gwI/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">It's not a demo, more of a philosophical argument: Why did Sergey Brin and his team at Google want to build an eye-mounted camera/computer, codenamed Glass?

Racket programmers may reach for linked lists when better structures would do to avoid the list-ref/vector-ref/stream-ref function zoo. This talk discusses the implementation of a generic collections system that encourages immutability by default, provides a more consistent and comprehensive interface across all data structures, and provides that interface in a way that can be leveraged by new, user-defined structures to feel as integrated with the language as Racket’s built-ins. Alexis King works as a full-stack web developer at Philosophie in Los Angeles building rich web applications with Ruby on Rails and Angular. When not tinkering with different models to create expressive RESTful APIs, she is enthusiastic about finding ways to build programming interfaces that are expressive and easy to use. In Racket, that means figuring out how to build flexible DSLs and extensible language constructs that integrate well into the rest of the Racket ecosystem without sacrificing elegance or hygiene.</p></div></li><li id="talk_e2ecd71e-75d9-47cf-86f2-5af5c2f6234f" data-talk-source-id="L3j2qw9XZCc" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">James Powell - Python and Johnny Cash</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">43 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L3j2qw9XZCc/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L3j2qw9XZCc/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">PyData London 2016 I was given this title by the Executive Director of NumFOCUS as punishment for being late in putting together a proposal.

Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine. However the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo. John McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript. https://twitter.com/gotocon https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference http://gotocon.com</p></div></li><li id="talk_1cff0cdf-9d39-4722-8301-25d7bb4f676e" data-talk-source-id="McFNkLPTOSY" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Dan Doel - Introduction to Low Level Haskell Optimization</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Haskell (Programming Language)</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/McFNkLPTOSY/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/McFNkLPTOSY/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Dan Doel's talk at the Boston Haskell Meetup, Sept 17, 2014 Slides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Kkr1O1jFwcRmhxbzBMR1Ntb3c/edit?usp=sharing</p></div></li><li id="talk_370afbc4-3664-453c-b5d7-5b27e490b901" data-talk-source-id="MpH8W5hce9I" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Craig Kerstiens: Postgres Performance for Humans - PyCon 2014</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">34 minutes</span><span class="tag">PyCon2014</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpH8W5hce9I/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpH8W5hce9I/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Speaker: Craig Kerstiens To many developers the database is a black box.

Lately, we are seeing an explosion in JVM languages. This is partly, but not only, because of Java 7, the first JVM to ship with invokedynamic, which is a quantum leap in polyglot runtime implementation. This session explains why emerging language implementations are becoming more common and more feasible to implement on the JVM with satisfactory performance. It tells you how we got there and walks through the technology already in place (such as invokedynamic) and that which is in progress. The future for the JVM is bright indeed.

Nanopass frameworks are designed to help manage this complexity. A nanopass compiler is comprised of many single-task passes with formally defined intermediate languages. The nanopass compiler technique evolved from a methodology for teaching a compiler course at Indiana University, into a full-fledged framework, capable of implementing a replacement for the Chez Scheme compiler that runs on par with the original compiler. This talk will discuss the idea of a nanopass compiler and the implementation of a simple language using the framework in Chez Scheme, along with the challenges and opportunities of using these techniques in Clojure. Andy is a postdoc at the University of Utah, currently working on malware detection in Android Apps, using both Scala and miniKanren to write abstract analyzers in Matt Might's lab. Andy completed his Ph.D. at Indiana University, defending his dissertation, &quot;A Nanopass Framework for Commercial Compiler Development&quot;, in December 2012 and will be presenting a paper related to this work at this year's International Conference on Functional Programming. This project focused on replacing Chez Scheme's compiler with a nanopass compiler, along with his adviser R. Kent Dybvig. Before returning to graduate school in 2007, Andy worked in industry as a web developer, first for the consulting firms Razorfish and Gotham Broadband, along with some independent consulting work for Viacom, and later worked full time at Teach For America, maintaining both front-end and back-end web applications.</p></div></li><li id="talk_5f5b1e9f-f68b-4dd7-8eec-ad2e0314b8c2" data-talk-source-id="PKc5IwHG68k" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Scala Versus Java</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">2 hours</span><span class="tag">scala</span><span class="tag">java</span><span class="tag">marakana</span><span class="tag">techtv</span><span class="tag">typesafe</span><span class="tag">dan rosen</span><span class="tag">sbt</span><span class="tag">jdk</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PKc5IwHG68k/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PKc5IwHG68k/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Java is no longer alone on the JVM.

Each new language has its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared to Java, and its own niche in which it performs best, but Scala in particular is gaining momentum. In this presentation to San Francisco Java User Group on January 18, 2012, Marakana's own Dan Rosen introduces Scala to Java developers and shows off some of its expressive power -- higher-order functions, type inference, and pattern matching -- by building a simple web service.

This talk discusses a generalized approach to match-expanders and its uses in defining macros with embedded user-extensible syntax, and shows an application of this approach to Racket’s command line parsing forms. Jack Firth works at Mindjet in San Francisco as a developer of enterprise web applications and as a mentor to his colleagues on functional programming, particularly its applications to a Node / Angular stack. He has been a professional software engineer for a year and a half, but first began programming nine years ago. He attended college for mechanical engineering at a young age.

Martin had been a professional programmer since 1970; since then he has become a prolific author and leader in the industry. Dan Bernier of New Haven’s Continuity Control and nhv.io, introduced Bob, noting that in the “weird and messy business” of software development, Uncle Bob is there to look out for and guide developers. Martin emphasized the importance of writing clean, efficient, well-written code—sage advise for aspiring programmers and tech-entrepreneurs. Interest in development and programming is on the rise at SOM as student-entrepreneurs explore tech-based startup ideas.

We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design. It also leads to code with potentially unwanted emergent properties. Today, we know how to create programs that can create programming languages. So why not write software that closely follows the problem, without a programming language, then let other programs create the programming language to support it? If we apply this rethinking to the design process, both problems and solutions can be thought of in terms of relational str</p></div></li><li id="talk_ca575fa9-e1bf-4720-9fed-655418466406" data-talk-source-id="QgrChOltYek" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Postcapitalism</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Jamie Dobson</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">GOTO Conference</span><span class="tag">Capitalism</span><span class="tag">Marx</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">This talk is about how software, particularly open-source software, is not only eating the world but eating capitalism itself - from the inside out. Last summer I read Paul Mason's Postcapitalism and thereafter Rifkin's The Zero Marginal Cost Society. As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors. After thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted. This talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos. I will give insights into how companies can still stay relevant even when software is free - and I will do this by looking at how windmills utterly disrupted landowners in 11th century Yorkshire.</p></div></li><li id="talk_bb18345d-1eec-4de1-a701-7e0b1995a335" data-talk-source-id="QleRgTBMX88" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">On being wrong</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Kathryn Schulz</span><span class="duration">18 minutes</span><span class="tag">TEDTalks</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QleRgTBMX88/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QleRgTBMX88/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong.

This is to C++'s excellent low-penalty abstractions and a memory model close to the machine. However, a large category of applications have no boundaries on desired speed, meaning there's no point of diminishing returns in making code faster. Better speed means less power consumed for the same work, more workload with the same data center expense, better features for the end user, more features for machine learning, better analytics, and more. Optimizing has always been an art, and in particular optimizing C++ on contemporary hardware has become a task of formidable complexity. This is because modern hardware has a few peculiarities about it that are not sufficiently understood and explored. This talk discusses a few such effects, and guides the attendee on how to navigate design and implementation options in search for better performance. -- Andrei Alexandrescu is a researcher, software engineer, and author.

Wait, come back! In contrast to most systems programming languages (whose semantics can be quite esoteric), the semantics of a query (given some inputs) are precisely its outcome -- rows in tables. Hence when we write a query, we directly engage with its semantics: we simply say what we mean. This makes it easy and natural to reason about whether our queries are correct: that is, whether they mean what we intended them to mean. Query languages have traditionally been applied to a relatively narrow domains: historically, data at rest in data stores; more recently, data in motion through continuous, &quot;streaming&quot; query frameworks. Why stop here? Could query languages do for a notoriously complex domain such as distributed systems programming what they have done so successfully for data management? How would they need to evolve to become expressive enough to capture the programs that we need to write, while retaining a simple enough semantics to allow mere mortals to reason about their correctness? I will attempt to answer these questions (and raise many others) by describing a query language for distributed programming called Dedalus. Like traditional query languages, Dedalus abstracts away many of the details we typically associate with programming, making data and time first-class citizens and relegating computation to a subordinate role, characterizing how data is allowed to change as it moves through space and time. As we will see, this shift allows programmers to directly reason about distributed correctness properties such as consistency and fault-tolerance, and lays the foundations for powerful program analysis and repair tools (such as Blazes and LDFI), as well as successive generations of data-centric programming languages (including Bloom, Edelweiss and Eve). Peter Alvaro UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ @palvaro Peter Alvaro is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Cruz. His research focuses on using data-centric languages and analysis techniques to build and reason about data-intensive distributed systems, in order to make them scalable, predictable and robust to the failures and nondeterminism endemic to large-scale distribution. Peter is the creator of the Dedalus language and co-creator of the Bloom language. While pursuing his PhD at while UC Berkeley, Peter co-developed and taught Programming the Cloud, an undergraduate course that explored distributed systems concepts through the lens of software development. Prior to attending Berkeley, Peter worked as a Senior Software Engineer in the data analytics team at Ask.com.

While all of this may sound incredibly futuristic, many of us still program these Dream Machines with miserly techniques not far removed from the best practices of the 1960s.

Link to slides: http://goo.gl/Nfy14D Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.</p></div></li><li id="talk_2c504d89-3b94-45f6-b183-7fd5465c85d1" data-talk-source-id="SphBW9ILVPU" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Lambda Calculus Then and Now</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">30 minutes</span><span class="tag">Calculus</span><span class="tag">Dana S.

Turing Laureate Dana S. Scott during the ACM A.M. Turing Centenary Celebration, June, 2012. Abstract: A very fast development in the early 1930s, following Hilbert's codification of Mathematical Logic, led to the Incompleteness Theorems, Computable Functions, Undecidability Theorems, and the general formulation of recursive Function Theory. The so-called Lambda Calculus played a key role. The history of these developments will be traced, and the much later place of Lambda Calculus in Mathematics and Programming-Language Theory will be outlined.</p></div></li><li id="talk_d279df59-f2e3-4536-b965-325a4b2f8c37" data-talk-source-id="T8J0j2xJFgQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Ruby Midwest 2011 Confident Code by Avdi Grimm</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">31 minutes</span><span class="tag">rubymidwest2011</span><span class="tag">Ruby (Programming Language)</span><span class="tag">Code</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Are your methods timid? Do they constantly second-guess themselves, checking for nil values, errors, and unexpected input? Even the cleanest Ruby codebases can become littered over time with nil checks, error handling, and other interruptions which steal attention away from the essential purpose of the code. This talk will discuss strategies for writing your Ruby classes and methods in a confident, straightforward style; without sacrificing functionality or robustness. In the process, we'll cover concepts and techniques points including: The narrative style of method construction The four parts of a method Three strategies for dealing with uncertain input Massaging input with coercion and the Decorator pattern Lightweight preconditions Exterminating nils from your code The chaining and iterative styles of method construction Eliminating conditionals with the Special Case and Null Object patterns Isolating errors with the Bouncer and Checked Method patterns</p></div></li><li id="talk_60957033-3814-44e2-a27d-b85fb940634b" data-talk-source-id="TGxEQhdi1AQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Apple iPad 2 Keynote</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Steve Jobs</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Apple</span><span class="tag">Keynote</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TGxEQhdi1AQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TGxEQhdi1AQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">http://bit.ly/gAAXPd This is the Apple Special Event 2011 which took place on 2nd March 2011 The iPad 2 is amazing! http://equimedia.blogspot.com/</p></div></li><li id="talk_665ad35a-03e3-4a3f-93bd-d37416ac5b07" data-talk-source-id="Tng6Fox8EfI" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">The Scribe's Oath</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">&quot;Uncle Bob&quot; - Robert Cecil Martin</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">GOTO Conference</span><span class="tag">Amsterdam</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tng6Fox8EfI/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tng6Fox8EfI/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">We are the modern day scribes.

Selectors, media queries, backgrounds, images, and text all have fresh recommendations to improve the web ecosystem. We’ll explore a little of each so you can be thinking ahead. The current state of polyfills and shims will be discussed so that the brave can forge ahead.

A multi-language, multi-target compiler infrastructure such as LLVM ameliorates the situation somewhat, but engineering fast, effective and correct optimizations for LLVM is challenging. Even after a decade of intense development, there is a long tail of unimplemented optimizations. University of Utah Associate Professor John Regehr presents Souper, a superoptimizer that gives us a look at some of the optimizations that are missing from LLVM while also avoiding the bugs that are often found in hand-written optimization passes. Souper works by turning LLVM code into queries for an automated theorem prover. When Souper is run on LLVM itself, it identifies thousands of uncaught optimizations and also ranks them according to the likely improvement in code size or code speed that would result from implementing each one.

The current status of the back-end will be explored, with an emphasis on the portions of the LLVM IR instruction set and PTX intrinsics that are currently supported during code generation. This talk will also highlight the difficulties and issues that have been discovered while writing an LLVM back-end for a virtual ISA such as PTX, such as infinite register files. Through-out the talk, examples will be provided to highlight key features of the back-end and show preliminary performance data. In addition to back-end details, this talk will also highlight the use of Clang as a front-end for generating PTX code for NVIDIA GPUs. Through the use of Clang and the CUDA Driver API, GPGPU programs can be developed that harness the optimization power of the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Finally, the talk will conclude with an exploration of the open issues that remain in the backend, and a discussion on how the back-end can be used within larger GPGPU compiler projects.</p></div></li><li id="talk_2b564b1b-3b97-49cd-955c-2c4a662069ef" data-talk-source-id="UzyoT4DziQ4" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Scott Hanselman, &quot;Virtual Machines, JavaScript and Assembler&quot; - Fluent 2014 Keynote</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">26 minutes</span><span class="tag">JavaScript (Programming Language)</span><span class="tag">Assembly Language (Programming Language)</span><span class="tag">fluent 2014</span><span class="tag">fluentconf</span><span class="tag">fluent conference</span><span class="tag">Virtual Machine (Programming Language Paradigm)</span><span class="tag">scott hanselman</span><span class="tag">keynote</span><span class="tag">speaker</span><span class="tag">podcaster</span><span class="tag">Programming Language (Literary Genre)</span><span class="tag">o'reilly books</span><span class="tag">O'Reilly Media (Business Operation)</span><span class="tag">oreilly</span><span class="tag">oreilly media</span><span class="tag">O'Reilly</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzyoT4DziQ4/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UzyoT4DziQ4/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Don't miss an upload!

It was organized by Mirego http://www.mirego.com/en We had Jake Wharton telling us more about some Ok Libraries at Droidcon Montreal. A Few &quot;OK&quot; Libraries: This talk will be an in-depth look at Okio—a tiny library for interacting with bytes—and a few of the libraries written on top of it: OkHttp, Retrofit, and a newcomer named Moshi. Okio evolved naturally inside of OkHttp before being split out into its own library. It wraps common patterns behind a friendly API for reading, writing, and processing data. We'll start with some fundamentals of the library and how it can enable you to work very close to raw data with ease. After an introduction to Okio, we will look at three libraries written with it: OkHttp, a modern HTTP client; Retrofit, a high-level HTTP wrapper; and Moshi, a brand new library for serialization. Not only are these libraries powerful on their own, but when combined their efficiency and performance dramatically increase. We'll conclude with demonstration of how to use them in your applications to great effect. - Jake Wharton Android developer for Square working on Square Cash.

In Idris, types are a first class language construct, meaning that they can be manipulated and computed like any other language construct. It encourages a type-driven style of development, in which programmers give types first and use interactive editing tools to derive programs. Introductory examples typically involve length-preserving operations on lists, or ordering invariants on sorting. Realistically, though, programming is not so simple: programs interact with users, communicate over networks, manipulate state, deal with erroneous input, and so on. In this talk I will show how advanced type systems allow us to express such interactions precisely, and how they support verification of stateful systems as a result. The talk will include several examples, leading to a verified implementation of a word game (Hangman). I will show how Type-driven Development allows programmers to specify the game rules in a direct and concise style, and how it leads to an implementation, guaranteed to correctly follow the rules by typechecking.</p></div></li><li id="talk_2533bf02-9de3-4067-9d01-94bf9efb445e" data-talk-source-id="X7lZ8MVGl4A" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">DCNW13 - Vim - I wish I knew how to :q you</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">41 minutes</span><span class="tag">drupal</span><span class="tag">VIM</span><span class="tag">UNIX</span><span class="tag">#DCNW13</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X7lZ8MVGl4A/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X7lZ8MVGl4A/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Chris has been working with Drupal since 2006, and has experience of developing projects at all levels.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour &quot;Shifting the Burden&quot; and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself. Dan believes you can learn to recognise these coping mechanisms for what they are, and intends to set you on the path to simplicating your programming life.

Functional programming is increasing in popularity these days given the inherent problems with shared mutable state that is rife in the imperative world. As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law. Of course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is &quot;the Way&quot;. Dr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9. This video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation. Of course, you can't just cover monads in a vacuum (category theory is not really addressed here) so the context is functional programming (Brian covers functions and composable functional structures (function chains) and of course monoids and then monads). Tune in. There's a lot to learn here and only Brian can make monads easy to understand for the rest of us!</p></div></li><li id="talk_6e84c36b-2b4e-413c-b182-0b02d4e9f229" data-talk-source-id="Zkx1aKv2z8o" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Making things with maths - Steven Wittens</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">javascript</span><span class="tag">web development</span><span class="tag">web</span><span class="tag">development</span><span class="tag">steven wittens</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zkx1aKv2z8o/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zkx1aKv2z8o/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">The browser used to be a meek sandbox, shut off from all the things that native apps could do.

This is not only a question of writing parallel algorithms, but also a matter of designing the application properly to reduce inter-thread dependencies. These dependencies may be very hard to find and are the results of decades of serial programming. Thus, writing truly scalable software is less a question of technical expertise than adopting the appropriate state of mind. This presentation is about the design, techniques and tools used by the team who wrote the hyperscalable database &quot;quasardb.&quot; Building upon concrete scalability challenges, the presenter will expose typical multithreading anti-patterns and how to avoid them. The topics covered include: atomics, micro locks, lock-free and wait-free containers, memory management strategies (copy on write, smart pointers, perfect forwarding...), thread local storage, asynchronous I/O, and much more!</p></div></li><li id="talk_a07f18e8-ae2b-45b0-b29b-3d748e7ec80b" data-talk-source-id="ZsHMHukIlJY" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Kevlin Henney</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Software Architecture</span><span class="tag">Software Design</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZsHMHukIlJY/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZsHMHukIlJY/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Habits help you manage the complexity of code.

With JavaFX. For game development. And it's all built on top of an in-memory, transactional graph database. One of the biggest game developers in the world needed a new IDE to build games for their engine. Eclipse just wasn't cutting it any more. It may sound a bit nuts to use Clojure for desktop GUIs, but this architecture delivers incredible benefits to the tool developers. About the speakers: You can find Michael Nygard coding, writing, speaking, or thinking about how the Universe works. He has lived with systems in production and learned hard lessons about the importance of operations. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte. Ragnar Svensson has worked as a game developer for many years, starting out with player mechanics for AAA console games and transitioning into game engine programming, primarily for the mobile and web platforms. He co-founded the game engine Defold, which was acquired by King in 2014.

When he’s not working at Heroku, he runs PlayfulJS, a website of cool JavaScript code snippets. One of the better well-known demos on PlayfulJS is a re-creation of the Doom rendering engine in JavaScript. After building this, Hunter was contacted by Warp records about building a first-person shooter in JavaScript. One of the issues with this request was the timeframe — three weeks to build the game to coincide with an album release, and with a tiny budget. On top of that, the game had to work on desktop, Android, and iOS. So, Hunter rationalized and decided to accept the project. After accepting the project for what he thought would be a small, indie release, Hunter realized that the artist (Rustie) was huge in the UK and overseas, and this release would be a huge deal.

All living organisms information systems are based on chemical processes. What can we learn by using this metaphor of chemistry in our programming? We will answer this question by looking at Artificial Chemical Computing. Building programs based on molecules and chemical reactions, we will explore new ways of thinking and opening ourselves up to innovation. We will discuss the basics of Chemical Programming and even touch on High Order Chemical Programming as well. Code examples will be in the powerful, elegant, and interactive programming language of Clojure, but you will not need to be an expert in the language to enjoy the demos.

Starting with building blocks such as fmap and (.), we build up combinators suitable for working with a wide array of data structures. These generalize the notions you already know how to use into a form that is easier to compose and simultaneously allow them to be used for monomorphic containers such as Data.Text. All without compromising on your ability to reason about them using laws! Finally, once I've built up some foundations, I do a bit of a deep dive, exploring consequences of this design. In particular we discuss the efficient generic programming programming framework exported by lens, and type-safe Traversal-based zippers. Familiarity with the Applicative and Traversable classes from the Haskell base libraries will be helpful (links provided below), but a basic understanding of the concepts get introduced as I go along. Useful (but not mandatory) references: The lens library and documentation: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens A previous, more introductory talk on how to use the lenses Edward Kmett wrote for the scalaz in the Scala programming language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efv0SQNde5Q The original Applicative paper: http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf Lots of information on Traversable: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf A write-up of this talk, as presented at the Bay Area Haskell Users Group: http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/10/lenses-folds-and-traversals-haskell.html The original Keynote version of the slides are available from http://comonad.com/haskell/Lenses-Folds-and-Traversals-NYC.key Thanks go to Johan Kiviniemi, who worked magic when it came to cleaning up the audio for this recording!</p></div></li><li id="talk_952089fb-0818-48bc-9720-2069c256a9e7" data-talk-source-id="cf3zxHuSM2Y" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Fighting viruses, defending the net</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Mikko Hypponen</span><span class="duration">18 minutes</span><span class="tag">TEDTalks</span><span class="tag">Viruses</span><span class="tag">Computer Security</span><span class="tag">Inspiring</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf3zxHuSM2Y/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cf3zxHuSM2Y/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">It's been 25 years since the first PC virus (Brain A) hit the net, and what was once an annoyance has become a sophisticated tool for crime and espionage.

To manage this complexity and build larger applications and systems, C++ strives to form emergent structures (often found in nature, such as snowflakes' symmetrical structures), where simple patterns combine to form a remarkably complex and powerful system. These structures provide both a means to limit the complexity of each component and the essential economies of scale we rely on when developing software. From handheld devices to warehouse-sized data centers, motivated by smaller devices and increased concerns over power consumption, we are relying upon C++ to deliver these complex systems with unmatched efficiency. Our optimizing compilers today are more important than ever before and are utterly opaque to most practicing programmers. Compounding matters, the very emergent structures which allow C++ systems to scale for humans often provide unique and unsolved challenges to optimization. In this talk, I will start with a brief overview of how modern optimizing compilers work with C++ code at a very high level. I will then walk through the specific structures and patterns of C++ code, which are at the core of forming emergent structures out of simple, elegant elements. I will also address how these interactions can be effectively modeled and analyzed by a compiler to produce efficient final programs. All of this will be illustrated by a collection of real world case studies, which are broadly applicable and show up throughout modern C++ code bases. My goal is to give a framework for understanding these interactions both in the C++ code and the optimizing compiler, so that programmers are aware of the implications posed by these patterns. Finally, I will introduce a set of principles and techniques for designing and implementing C++ programs and libraries to specifically clear the way for modern optimizers while retaining the simplicity of each component and the power of the combined whole.</p></div></li><li id="talk_a1b64fd6-4d92-4418-8d2a-cce55d8286b0" data-talk-source-id="eRq5UBx6cbA" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Parallel Programming, Fork Join, and Reducers - Daniel Higginbotham (with slides)</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">41 minutes</span><span class="tag">clojure</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eRq5UBx6cbA/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eRq5UBx6cbA/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">If you don't know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you!

They also make it difficult to write really fast code that exploits the CPU amenities to their fullest. And the smart money is on fast code—we're running out of cool things to do with slow code, and the battle will be on doing really interesting and challenging things at the envelope of what the computing fabric endures. So how to write quick code, quickly? Turns out it's quite difficult because today's complex architectures defy simple rules to be applied everywhere. It is not uncommon that innocuous high-level artifacts have a surprisingly high impact on the bottom line of an application's run time (and power consumed). This talk is an attempt to set forth a few pieces of tactical advice for writing quick code in C++. Applying these is not guaranteed to produce optimal code, but is likely to put it reasonably within the ballpark. These tips are based on practical experience but also motivated by the inner workings of modern CPUs.</p></div></li><li id="talk_7d178286-f7ae-4e98-9065-e13831ac86e7" data-talk-source-id="ecIWPzGEbFc" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">The Future of Programming</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">&quot;Uncle Bob&quot; - Robert Cecil Martin</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Clean Code</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ecIWPzGEbFc/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ecIWPzGEbFc/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">How did our industry start, what paths did it take to get to where we are, and where is it going.

Over the last few years, there has been a stronger emphasis on functional programming languages and constructs in mainstream programming. The rise of FP popularity is not due to concurrency (although still valid), but the recognition that minimizing side-effects yields to smaller code that is easier to test and reason about. ClojureScript finally brings that perspective to the front-end world. This talk is an introduction to a different kind of front-end development.

There is a good chance it is in part because of concerns about the performance of your software. Whether they stem from needing to run on every smaller mobile devices, squeezing the last few effects into video game, or because every watt of power in your data center costs too much, C++ programmers throughout the industry have an insatiable desire for writing high performance code. Unfortunately, even with C++, this can be really challenging. Over the past twenty years processors, memory, software libraries, and even compilers have radically changed what makes C++ code fast. Even measuring the performance of your code can be a daunting task. This talk will dig into how modern processors work, what makes them fast, and how to exploit them effectively with modern C++ code. It will teach you how modern C++ optimizers see your code today, and how that is likely to change in the coming years. It will teach you how to reason better about the performance of your code, and how to write your code so that it performs better. You will even learn some tricks about how to measure the performance of your code. -- Chandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative style. In realizing this vision, we develop algebras for visual presentation and for &quot;deep&quot; function application, where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples, functions, etc. Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations. Speaker: Conal Elliott Most of my research is aimed at supporting the creation of interactive synthetic media content, including computer animation, human-computer interaction, images, 2D and 3D geometry, and programmable shaders. In all cases, I aim to preserve or improve on the flexibility and performance of mainstream programming approaches, while greatly simplifying the creation process. Synthetic media programs are almost always implemented in sequential, imperative (often object-oriented) languages. My research explores use of declarative languages, resulting in much simpler and more reusable and composable programs. These languages are also more amenable to execution on parallel architectures such as modern graphics processors, because declarative languages abstract away from order of execution, removing the accidental sequentiality found in imperative programs. Even on sequential machines, declarative formulations have much simpler mathematical semantics, which facilitates automatic optimization. They also tend to be spatially and temporally continuous (resolution-independent), allowing them to adapt naturally to machines with different speeds and display resolutions. After exploring explicit programming of synthetic media content for several years, I'm now also keenly interested in supporting artists. The goal of my new new research agenda is to give artists access to the expressive power of computers and programming languages, while retaining an artist's working style. I mean &quot;artist&quot; in a broad sense, in contrast to the verbal and sequential style of an engineer. (I don't mean to suggest that people fit neatly into these two categories.) My ideal audience includes graphic designers, musicians, and children -- really, the playful and curious in all of us.

Using Racket, we have built program languages ranging from large, general-purpose languages matching particular programming paradigms to small, specialized programming languages designed for just a single file in some larger program. In this talk, I will bring across how it feels to program in such a language, discuss some of the technical support Racket has to make such programming practical, and show how Racket’s standard libraries have embraced this perspective, enabling us to include lots of batteries.

Currently, to create an interactive diagram one must write code to procedurally draw the diagram and respond appropriately to user input. Writing this code can take hours or days. Apparatus aims to reduce the time to create an interactive diagram from hours to minutes. Apparatus combines the direct manipulation capabilities of a vector graphics editor with the dataflow capabilities of a spreadsheet. Through this hybridization, Apparatus supports both spatial and symbolic ways of working in tandem. Dataflow defines the state space of a diagram, algebra driving geometry. Dragging shapes moves through this state space, geometry driving algebra. Instead of function calls or object-oriented inheritance, Apparatus uses a &quot;call by copying&quot; pattern for diagram reuse. Reused diagrams do not need to be explicitly parameterized. Instead of loops, Apparatus uses spreads which allow any value to exist in a &quot;superposition&quot;. This allows shapes to be looped over implicitly. By decomposing shapes into paths of points, it also enables Apparatus to plot curves.

Speaker: Venkat Subramaniam No Slides at speaker request There is a good amount of excitement about the new version of Java. The big evolution of course is the lambda expressions. In this presentation we will dive into the language features in Java 8, take a look at some of their nuances, and look at ways to put them to good use. In addition to looking at lambdas we will also dive into the Streams capabilities and also some of the features in Java 8 that make all these possible.

The idea never went beyond its seminal stage. In the present study I try to make it less fuzzy by relating it to the ontologically interpreted category theory, where &quot;ontological interpretation&quot; should be understood &quot;in the sense of Quine&quot;. Roughly speaking, the ontology in the sense of Quine does not aspire to establish what does exist, but rather what a given theory or doctrine assumes there exists. To construct such an ontology, one should paraphrase a given doctrine into the first order logical calculus and look for those variables that are bound by the existential quantifiers. Only those entities that correspond to such variables are postulated to exist. However, in principle each topos has its own &quot;internal logic&quot;. Consequently, we should apply Quine's program to each such category individually (by employing its own internal logic), and speak about the ontology in the sense of Quine characteristic for a given category in terms of a given logical calculus (if Quine's program is realisable in this logic). However, the Quine ontological program does not directly refer to the internal logic of a given theory, but rather to the logic with the help of which we are interpreting this theory (the external or meta-logic), and this is expected to be the standard classical logic. This is also the case with respect to category theory. When developing this theory, for instance by proving theorems, we are using standard logical laws of inference. This is why we seem entitled to ontologically interpret category theory strictly following Quine's recipe (i.e. with the help of the first order logical calculus), but we should be aware that this could be conditioned by the fact that our brain is a macroscopic object embedded into the world having the ontology characteristic for the category of sets. Having these caveats in mind I sketch &quot;ontological commitments&quot; of category theory and briefly signal some underlying philosophical problems. *** This talk was delivered during the conference ���The Limits of Physics and Cosmology” organized by Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. There exist various kinds of limits which are inherent in cosmological research and physics. The most conspicuous one is connected with scientific method itself. It manifests itself during attempts to construct (or discover) suitable mathematical structures to model the physical world. However, this limit may be even more profound. Over the past 300 years we have become accustomed to the mathematical and empirical method which has proven to be uncannily successful in describing the enclosing universe. But is there a fundamental limit to the method itself which is intrinsic to the structure of the world? Another group of limits which are more connected to ourselves – as human beings – are conceptual ones. The two monumental theories of physics of the 20th century – General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics - are incompatible and this inconsistency is not only on the mathematical level, but also on the conceptual. Usually scientists believe that the reconciliation between the relativist and quantum realms is possible. But is there a conceptual limit within ourselves as elements of the world?</p></div></li><li id="talk_2685128a-2f90-4f58-8be3-4b44cb8512e9" data-talk-source-id="kNrnRG1YgAQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Large Scale JavaScript Application Architecture</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Dan Lynch</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">HTML5DevConf 2014</span><span class="tag">JavaScript</span><span class="tag">Node.js</span><span class="tag">Code Modularization</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kNrnRG1YgAQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kNrnRG1YgAQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Large Scale JavaScript Application Architecture Time: Wednesday @ 10:40am | Room E-131 http://html5devconf.com/index.html #HTML5DevConf Learn how to build your team and technology without losing development time.

In the early 1990s, the C++ standardisation committee adopted the Vasa as a cautionary tale, discouraging prospective language extensions with &quot;Remember the Vasa!&quot; Yet C++ continued to grow, and by the time C++ was standardised, its complexity made the Vasa look like a rowboat. The Vasa sank, however, while C++ cruised, and it looks likely to continue doing so even as the latest revised standards (C++11 and C++14) add dozens of new features, each with its own idiosyncrasies. Clearly, C++ has gotten some important things right.

Fast forward 15 years. All that time I'd been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling.

Code that aims to manipulate these nested data structures complects navigation code with the desired query or transformation. Code like this is painful to write and ugly to read. Specter is a library that makes querying and transformation of nested data structures simple, easy, and efficient. At its core it abstracts away the concept of data structure navigation and makes these navigations highly composable. Specter can manipulate any of Clojure's maps, sequences, records, and sets, and by hooking into Specter's protocols you can use it to manipulate any data structure. On top of all this, Specter is highly performant: for example, Specter's equivalent to update-in runs 5x faster. Once you've used Specter, it's hard to imagine programming Clojure without it.

But C++ does not give you these things for free, it gives you the tools to control these things and achieve them where needed. How do you realize this potential of the language? How do you tune your C++ code and achieve the necessary performance metrics? This talk will walk through the process of tuning C++ code from benchmarking to performance analysis. It will focus on small scale performance problems ranging from loop kernels to data structures and algorithms. It will show you how to write benchmarks that effectively measure different aspects of performance even in the face of advanced compiler optimizations and bedeviling modern CPUs. It will also show how to analyze the performance of your benchmark, understand its behavior as well as the CPUs behavior, and use a wide array of tools available to isolate and pinpoint performance problems. The tools and some processor details will be Linux and x86 specific, but the techniques and concepts should be broadly applicable. -- Chandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

It must also help programmers be productive writing ordinary maintainable code. There is much more &quot;ordinary code&quot; than there is performance-critical code. Thus, C++ must make simple tasks simple while not getting in the way of tuning software for the last byte and last cycle where that's necessary. This talk focuses on what C++11 and C++14 offers to simplify programming: auto, range-for loops, move semantics, futures, concepts, and more. However, the focus is not primarily on language features: the key is programming: how can we write better, more readable, efficient, and more maintainable code? If you think that the essence of C++ is clever pointer manipulation and huge class hierarchies you may be in for a few surprises.</p></div></li><li id="talk_8e780281-16bc-4fbe-895f-a874d3ebacac" data-talk-source-id="o6L6XeNdd_k" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Category Theory by Tom LaGatta</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">2 hours</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6L6XeNdd_k/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6L6XeNdd_k/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Read more information here: http://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/mathematics-lectures-for-software-engineers-category-theory-by-tom-lagatta Filmed at the March 11, 2014 LispNYC meetup at Meetup HQ in NYC.</p></div></li><li id="talk_5161fc0b-dcf8-422c-b02d-6c40679f770d" data-talk-source-id="o9pEzgHorH0" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Stop Writing Classes</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Jack Diederich</span><span class="duration">28 minutes</span><span class="tag">PyCon 2012</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o9pEzgHorH0/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o9pEzgHorH0/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Classes are great but they are also overused.

One of ClojureScript's goals is to provide features that Javascript lacks. Some of these features are macros, concurrent programming and persistent data structures. With the release of ES6 and other Javascript advancements, one might ask &quot;is ClojureScript still relevant?&quot;. In this talk, we will discuss how ClojureScript stacks up against ES6. Code examples in Javascript and ClojureScript will be demonstrated. At the end of the talk, an attendee will have enough information to make an informed decision about using ClojureScript.

Does modeling your problem domain into CRUD-able entities feel like fitting a square peg into a round hole? Have you ever tried implementing a PATCH request (without going crazy), or debated PUT vs. POST for resource updates? An alternative to CRUD-flavored REST is CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation). In this talk, I'll discuss the advantages and trade-offs of CQRS (and its cousin, Event Sourcing), and demonstrate them using an implementation of CQRS based on Clojure microservices, Kafka, and Datomic. These advantages include: Operational simplicity, flexibility, and extensibility Applying Clojure's sound model of state transitions to the resources exposed by your web application Simplified client implementation BONUS: We'll even be able to keep the best parts of REST! I'll also discuss how this technique dovetails nicely with other good ideas in the Clojure community like the design of Datomic and the ideas behind Om.Next. About the speaker: Bobby is a member of the Technology Fellows team at Capital One, where he designs and develops solutions to difficult problems, influences the technical direction of Capital One while helping development teams implement that technical direction, and engages the broader technical community via speaking and open-source contribution.</p></div></li><li id="talk_9ad1d853-e32b-47ee-b7b1-8493588755c3" data-talk-source-id="qI_g07C_Q5I" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Introduction to NoSQL</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Martin Fowlers</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">GOTO</span><span class="tag">NoSql</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qI_g07C_Q5I/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qI_g07C_Q5I/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Martin gives a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency.

This has led to that the features it provides and its limitations are different from most other VMs. In this talk we will why the BEAM looks like it does and how this affects the implementation of languages on it. We will also show the Erlang compiler workflow and how to use this when implementing languages. Finally we will show examples of how to &quot;go beyond&quot; the BEAM and implement features for which it was wasn't originally designed and the costs this can entail. About Robert: While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world. at present, he is the Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd.</p></div></li><li id="talk_5a06f0cc-bab2-4b1b-b8a2-bb3070d0c660" data-talk-source-id="qqQNqIy5LdM" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Lead Designer of Scala, Martin Odersky: What's Next for Scala</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Scala</span><span class="tag">2.10</span><span class="tag">What's</span><span class="tag">Next</span><span class="tag">Martin</span><span class="tag">Odersky</span><span class="tag">SF Scala</span><span class="tag">Marakana</span><span class="tag">TechTV</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqQNqIy5LdM/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qqQNqIy5LdM/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Martin Odersky, the creator of Scala, talks to the SF Scala user group about what's next for Scala.

Elixir and Phoenix can leverage the 30 years head-start of the underlying Erlang platform, but for newcomers to the platform it is not always easy to find and apply Erlang best practices. This talk explores some specific security-related aspects of Elixir, Phoenix and the Erlang VM, through practical demonstrations and use-cases. Topics covered include: use of Erlang's 'ssl' module, distributed Erlang, and VM hardening against DoS attacks. Talk objectives The purpose of this talk is to make people familiar with some of the Erlang/Elixir specific security considerations. It is focussed on those things that may surprise people coming to Elixir from other languages, and therefore skims over common attack patterns (XSS, CSRF, SQLI, etc.) and their mitigations. Target audience Anyone planning to deploy an Elixir application, with or without experience in deployment/security using other languages/platforms. Bram is a system architect and security advocate at Cisco Systems. His work focusses on massively concurrent back-end systems for IoT/IoE applications, preferably built using Erlang/Elixir, as well as PKI-based security solutions for such environments. He has previously built/designed API servers using Ruby on Rails, as well as VoIP soft switches in Java.</p></div></li><li id="talk_d604e2bf-1b63-4fa6-9fe5-3e5e89dcf07e" data-talk-source-id="rFejpH_tAHM" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Simplicity is Complicated</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Rob Pike</span><span class="duration">23 minutes</span><span class="tag">dotGo</span><span class="tag">Simplicity</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFejpH_tAHM/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rFejpH_tAHM/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Go is often described as a simple language.

It started in November 2015 when I left my job as a project manager, and by April 2016 I was hired as a Data Scientist by a startup developing bleeding edge deep learning algorithms for medical imagery processing. SHORT INTRO Who I am, my background and short summary of my story. Here I will list the steps I personally took to achieve the goal I had. HOW DID I DO IT? Why I chose a “hacky” way to enter this career path. First mover advantage, why getting a degree doesn’t always improve your career prospects. Possibly a rant on the signalling function of formal education and how that is rarely aligned with a relevant practical skill set. Some stats to back it up (best career success predictors). Examples of hacking bureaucracies/social hierarchies from my experience and elsewhere. List of things not to do and common cognitive pitfalls. Networking for nerds - how to do it right. Time management for chronic procrastinators - how to plan a self-guided project. Some notes on psychology of time discounting and need for external reinforcement, with autobiographical examples. CONCLUSION You don’t need a PhD or even a masters to do machine learning. On taking calculated risks and especially calculated exits from one’s comfort zone. Some notes on soul searching and how to choose a career that is also a passion. Reading list.

In this talk, I give a sneak peak at a standalone 3D engine with a purely functional API, comprised mostly of combinators that operate on scene databases. I intend it to replace Plot's internal 3D engine, which draws on Cairo device contexts, but also be flexible and efficient enough to render simple game scenes using OpenGL.

Although it is easy to avoid missing points and noise to some level, it is not easy to detect wrong measurements and outliers in the dataset. These outliers may present a larger problem in time-series signals since every data point has a temporal dependency to the data point before and after. Therefore, it is crucially important to be able to detect and possibly correct these outliers. In this talk, I will introduce three different methods to be able to detect outliers in time-series signals; Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Median Filtering and Bayesian approach. http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-03-31/outlier-detection-in-time-series-signals-fft-median-filtering/</p></div></li><li id="talk_97183daa-6f56-487c-8572-a34c0de7ac23" data-talk-source-id="tYclUdcsdeo" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">The 100,000-student classroom</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Peter Norvig</span><span class="duration">6 minutes</span><span class="tag">TEDtalks</span><span class="tag">Inspiring</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYclUdcsdeo/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYclUdcsdeo/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">In the fall of 2011 Peter Norvig taught a class with Sebastian Thrun on artificial intelligence at Stanford attended by 175 students in situ -- and over 100,000 via an interactive webcast.

He's spent the last 5 years developing the language, writing a lot of code and drawing a lot of conclusions, but has decided to walk away. In this talk, he explains why. He outlines what he believes to be certain shortcomings of the Scala collections library. In Paul's words, &quot;Based on my extensive experience with Scala collections, I'm writing my own. The focus is much tighter: immutable, performant, predictable, correct. The talk will alternate between why the Scala collections manage none of those things, and how I hope to do better.&quot; A day after the SF Scala event, Paul left this comment on their meetup page, which seems relevant, &quot;[...] I already discovered that if I say nothing about it then people will draw very incorrect conclusions about what the major issues are and why I've moved on. It's not sad, it's not happy, it's only a question of whether you want the real picture or some distant reflection of it.&quot; Follow along with Paul's slides: http://crcl.to/zdybs Free Scala resources: http://crcl.to/zhwdp Professional Scala training: http://crcl.to/w6kf7 Information on SF Scala: http://sfscala.org</p></div></li><li id="talk_6d676fa8-4d12-4604-886c-f20ea70f1b22" data-talk-source-id="usEs3GPnZDg" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Zandra Norman - Scaling Distributed Erlang (ElixirConfEu 2016)</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Zandra Norman</span><span class="tag">Erlang</span><span class="tag">ElixirConfEu</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/usEs3GPnZDg/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/usEs3GPnZDg/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Slides and more info: http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2016/zandra-norman One of the great things with Erlang is how easy it is to distribute.

But the real impact from advanced analytics comes from building models that make real-time decisions within production workflows. We will discuss how to use the ecosystem of technologies around Hadoop to support bringing models out of the lab and into the factory, with a focus on strategies for data integration, large-scale machine learning, and experimentation.

They are simple high order functions agnostic of the notion of iterator or collection and can be combined by simple function composition. They can later be applied eagerly or lazily over iterators, but most interestingly, also to other kinds of &quot;reactive&quot; sources, like networked streams, inter-process channels or reactive observables (e.g. RxCpp). Not only they provide an elegant decoupling between the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;how&quot; and higher level of reuse, their implementation is often simpler and and more performant than similar boost::range adaptors. Transducers were introduced in Clojure by Rich Hickey. At Ableton we implemented them in C++ and released them as part of our Open Source modern C++ toolkit: Atria. Our implementation introduces innovations of its own, like implementing state-full transducers without mutation, enabling further safety and reusability. We also use Eric Niebler's technique to describe and check its concepts in standard compliant C++11. In this session we will introduce the concept of transducers and how they can be implemented in modern C++.</p></div></li><li id="talk_ad2bb66e-b1ef-4aa6-b728-6c4e55667941" data-talk-source-id="vzzABBxo44g" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Cliff Click - Bits of advice for VM writers - Curry On</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">44 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzzABBxo44g/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzzABBxo44g/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Curry On Prague, July 7th, 2015 http://curry-on.org http://2015.ecoop.org</p></div></li><li id="talk_cb60ea2e-708e-42e1-a514-aed338003ab2" data-talk-source-id="w1zcUNMwac0" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Juan Manuel Santos - Salting things up in the sysadmin's world</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">37 minutes</span><span class="tag">saltstack</span><span class="tag">management</span><span class="tag">python</span><span class="tag">configuration</span><span class="tag">linux</span><span class="tag">EuroPython2015</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1zcUNMwac0/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w1zcUNMwac0/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Juan Manuel Santos - Salting things up in the sysadmin's world [EuroPython 2015] [21 July 2015] [Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain] SaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in Python that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no introduction. This talk will cover a brief summary of why we need configuration management tools, followed by a full dive into SaltStack, its features, pros and cons, how to use it and how to extend it. By the end of this talk you will have gone from knowing little or nothing about SaltStack, to being able to deploy your own setup. This talk will be targeted to either seasoned Python developers who are taking their first steps in the system administration world, or established system administrators who secretly love Python and prefer to stay away of configuration management systems based on other languages. Its advisable that attendees have some familiarity with Python as well as with system administration concepts. Also, this presentation will be focused on GNU/Linux systems, so it is expected that attendees are comfortable with some of its concepts.</p></div></li><li id="talk_d8463b2b-e941-489b-bad1-fb0fd3171c43" data-talk-source-id="wASCH_gPnDw" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Expert to Expert: Inside Clojure</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">Rich Hickey and Brian Beckman</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">clojure</span><span class="tag">programming languages</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wASCH_gPnDw/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wASCH_gPnDw/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Clojure is a dynamic programming language created by Rich Hickey that targets both the Java Virtual Machine and the CLR. It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection. Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs. Astrophysicist and Software Architect Brian Beckman interviews Rich Hickey to dig into the details of this very interesting language. If you don't know much about Clojure and the general problems it aims to solve, well, watch and listen carefully to this great conversation with plenty of whiteboarding and outstanding questions. Expert to Expert simply rocks! Thank you for spending time with us, Rich! Clojure is great!</p></div></li><li id="talk_8fe87ee5-cda7-4b3a-af52-9fffaf115a42" data-talk-source-id="wQxj20X-tIU" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">CppCon 2014: Scott Meyers &quot;Type Deduction and Why You Care&quot;</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Computer Science (Field of Study)</span><span class="tag">C (Programming Language)</span><span class="tag">Bash Films</span><span class="tag">Conference Video Recording</span><span class="tag">Event Video Recording</span><span class="tag">Video Conferencing</span><span class="tag">video conferencing equipment</span><span class="tag">videoconference</span><span class="tag">video services</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQxj20X-tIU/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQxj20X-tIU/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">http://www.cppcon.org — Presentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014 -- C++98 had template type deduction, and it worked so intuitively, there was little need to understand what took place under the covers. C++11 extends type deduction to include universal references, applies it to auto variables and lambda expressions, then throws in a special auto-only deduction rule. C++14 pushes the boundary further, adding two forms of function return type deduction (auto and decltype(auto)) for arbitrary functions and offering auto parameters for lambdas. The result is that what could be treated as a black box in C++98 has become a topic that practicing C++ developers really need to understand.

And this is fair; there's no better way to make you feel pitifully mainstream than throwing category theory at you. Conversely, JS programmers tend to believe functional programming, therefore, can have no real world application because nobody in the real world has any idea what a Yoneda lemma is and they seem to be getting by just fine without it. Except we aren't. We've been living in callback hell for almost two decades now, and no matter how many control flow libraries we submit to npm, things don't seem to be getting any better. And that's where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming. To demonstrate, I'll attempt to write a browser based game, from scratch, with ponies, using RxJS, everybody's favourite reactive library, live on stage in 30 minutes with no callback hell in sight. And we'll be finding out if this reactive stuff is all it's cracked up to be or not. http://2014.jsconf.us/</p></div></li><li id="talk_62e07d37-abb5-4750-91f4-085e69a82414" data-talk-source-id="xFy_8n_HdI4" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">ICFP 2014: Safe Zero-Cost Coercions for Haskell - Richard A.

Sadly, this means we're all basically stuck in an abusive relationship with JavaScript. Obviously not a desirable position to find ourselves in, we've tried breaking out of the JS trap in a variety of ways: JS dialects (solving no design flaws but at least looking prettier) and JS as a compilation target (resulting, mostly, in unappealingly large output to support the emulated runtimes). So when I found myself having to build a system with real deliverable size constraints, my only options seemed to be JS itself, or TypeScript, which doesn't add much to JS but at least provides a modicum of type checking. After a few months of fighting TypeScript, though, I'd had enough. Happily, my frustration coincided with the advent of PureScript. At first glance, PureScript looks and feels like Haskell, but there's hardly any extraneous machinery. The PureScript compiler generates very concise JS, and the language itself is designed with the platform's constraints in mind. Yet it offers things like higher kinded polymorphism, type classes and similar deep Haskell magic. More appealingly, it comes with a growing number of libraries for coping with the browser as a platform: functional DOM manipulation, reactive programming, and more. It turned out to be a delight, getting out of my tangled mess of JavaScript and rebuilding it all in PureScript, and I'd like to show you how and why. by Bodil Stokke (@bodil) - Future Ad Labs Bodil is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she's still learning how to stop.

In decades past, models of human language were wrought from the sweat and pencils of linguists. In the modern day, it is more common to think of language modeling as an exercise in probabilistic inference from data: we observe how words and combinations of words are used, and from that build computer models of what the phrases mean. This approach is hopeless with a small amount of data, but somewhere in the range of millions or billions of examples, we pass a threshold, and the hopeless suddenly becomes effective, and computer models sometimes meet or exceed human performance. This talk gives examples of the data available in large repositories of text, images, and videos, and shows some tasks that can be accomplished with the resulting models.</p></div></li><li id="talk_bcf18091-ba24-4b06-8476-0ebf25f5887d" data-talk-source-id="yvMWUGx7Fx8" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">DjangoCon EU 2013: Brandon Rhodes - Keynote</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">31 minutes</span><span class="tag">djangocon</span><span class="tag">djangocon europe 2013</span><span class="tag">djangocon europe</span><span class="tag">python</span><span class="tag">heroku</span><span class="tag">keynote</span><span class="tag">brandon rhodes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvMWUGx7Fx8/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvMWUGx7Fx8/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">Videos from DjangoCon Europe 2013 are kindly provided by Heroku, a cloud application platform -- a new way of building and deploying web apps: http://heroku.com/</p></div></li><li id="talk_6ea43f7a-b39d-42b5-a129-6d88a2ffc659" data-talk-source-id="z9Hmys8ojno" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Brandon Rhodes - Oh, Come On Who Needs Bytearrays - PyCon 2015</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">44 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9Hmys8ojno/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9Hmys8ojno/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description"></p></div></li><li id="talk_b30c39d2-201f-48cc-afa8-7d6ab7f42c17" data-talk-source-id="zSYo7m5kGHQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Alex Sexton: Your Very Own Component Library | JSConf.ar 2014</h3><div class="meta"><span class="duration">20 minutes</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSYo7m5kGHQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSYo7m5kGHQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">We're all pretty big fans of Bootstrap. It's a component library that helps us turn our ideas into reality faster than we've ever been able to do in the past. Unfortunately, it's kind of bland (on purpose!), and all the sites on the internet are starting to look the same. At Stripe, we wanted the same power of being able to spin up projects quickly, but without using Bootstrap, specifically. So we made &quot;Bootstripe&quot;. It's able to be much more opinionated, and allows lots of parallel developers to build consistent user interfaces. I'd love to tell you how to build your own, how to test it, and how to integrate it into your applications. https://jsconfar.com</p></div></li><li id="talk_dd087438-d929-464d-a055-ad3bccb1e4fb" data-talk-source-id="zwtg7lIMUaQ" class="talk"><div class="card"><h3 class="title">Professional Software Development</h3><div class="meta"><span class="presenter">&quot;Uncle Bob&quot; - Robert Cecil Martin</span><span class="duration">an hour</span><span class="tag">Software Engineering</span><span class="tag">Carrer</span><span class="tag">Agile</span><span class="tag">NDC Conference 2012</span></div><img alt="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwtg7lIMUaQ/default.jpg" height="90" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zwtg7lIMUaQ/default.jpg" width="120" class="preview"><p class="description">We’ve come a long way in the last 20 years. We start our journey in the late 80s and our &quot;discovery&quot; of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession. What will that profession require of us, and who among us can truly claim to be professional?</p></div></li></ul></div><div class="wrapper"><h2>Contributing</h2><p>Have you seen an awesome talk which is currently missing on this website?
