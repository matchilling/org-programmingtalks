The JVM / Java can be found powering HFT systems, low latency distributed databases, and real-time analytics platforms in almost every enterprise. During this talk you will come to understand the Java memory and concurrency models, how they interact with modern architectures, and the implications for how you ought to design your software. I will share my experiences designing, scaling and tuning a massive scale real-time analytics system, both the failures and the successes.\n\nby Cliff Moon (@moonpolysoft) - Boundary\n\nCliff Moon is the founder and CTO of Boundary.
