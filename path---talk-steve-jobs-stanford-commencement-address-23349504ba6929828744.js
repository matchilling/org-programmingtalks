Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon.\n\nBut how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples.\n\nI use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture. Developing a "modern style," however, is essential if we don\'t want to maintain newly-written 1970s and 1980s style code in 2020.\n\nThis presentation reflects my thoughts on what "Modern C++" should mean in the 2010s: a language for programming based on light-weight abstraction with direct and efficient mapping to hardware, suitable for infrastructure code.',meta:{duration:"PT1H29M48S"},presenter:{name:"Bjarne Stroustrup"},source:{id:"0iWb_qi2-uI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"keynote-goingnative-2012",tag:["C++","GoingNative","Keynote"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iWb_qi2-uI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Keynote GoingNative 2012 C++"}},{node:{description:"Hartmut Kaisers Keynote from Meeting C++ 2014\n\nSlides:\nhttp://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv14/items/26.html",meta:{duration:"PT1H27M36S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"4OCUEgSNIAY",provider:"youtube"},slug:"plain-threads-are-the-goto-of-todays-computing-hartmut-kaiser-keynote-meeting-c-2014",tag:["Software (Industry)","C (Programming Language)","C++","Meeting C++","Keynote","Parallelism","Concurrency","Threading","Thread","HPX","Meeting C++ 2014"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4OCUEgSNIAY/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Plain Threads are the GOTO of todays computing - Hartmut Kaiser - Keynote Meeting C++ 2014"}},{node:{description:"\"The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you're doing.\"\nPresented at Dropbox's DBX conference on July 9, 2013.\nAll of the slides are available at: http://worrydream.com/dbx/\n\nFor his recent DBX Conference talk, Victor took attendees back to the year 1973, donning the uniform of an IBM systems engineer of the times, delivering his presentation on an overhead projector. The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: \"We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.\" And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'\"",meta:{duration:"PT32M56S"},presenter:{name:"Bret Victor"},source:{id:"8pTEmbeENF4",provider:"youtube"},slug:"the-future-of-programming",tag:["Inspiring","Funny","DBX conference 2013"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pTEmbeENF4/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"The Future of Programming"}},{node:{description:"Systems get bigger, technologies reach further, practices mature, advice changes... or at least some of it does. Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron.
