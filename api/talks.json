However, models and inference algorithms can be difficult to specify and implement, let alone design, validate, or optimize. Additionally, inference often appears to be intractable. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field that aims to address these challenges by formalizing modeling and inference using key ideas from probability theory, programming languages, and Turing-universal computation.\n\nThis talk will illustrate the common underlying principles of probabilistic programming using three research platforms:\n\nBayesDB, a Bayesian database that enables users to directly query the probable implications of data tables without training in statistics. It provides BQL, an SQL-like language for Bayesian data analysis, and MML, a minimal language for building generative population models by combining automatic model-building techniques with qualitative constraints and custom statistical code. BayesDB has been applied to problems such as cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites and assessing the evidence for microbial biomarkers of Kwashiorkor, a form of severe malnutrition.\n\nPicture, an imperative probabilistic language for 3D scene perception. Picture uses deep neural networks and statistical learning to invert generative models based on computer graphics. 50-line Picture programs can infer 3D models of human poses, faces, and other object classes from single images.\n\nVenture, an integrated platform that aims to be sufficiently expressive, efficient, and extensible for general-purpose use. It provides VentureScript, a language that gives users fine-grained control over both modeling and inference, and defines a common interface for integrating components written in other probabilistic languages. Recent applications include structure discovery from time-series via Gaussian processes and reflective AI techniques such as Bayesian optimization.\n\nVikash K.

Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon.\n\nBut how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples.\n\nI use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture.

Imagine booting to the BEAM VM in just a few seconds with your Elixir app in control of the entire system. Nerves makes this possible while replacing the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files with a toolchain that is delightful to use. The Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at start-up time: Elixir. Together, we'll explore the principles Nerves uses to create embedded systems that control 3d printers, power unmanned areal vehicles, and more. You'll see first-hand how Nerves can support service discovery, hot code swapping, and collaboration through PubSub messages and mesh networking. Finally, we will explore the Nerves development life-cycle; from running ExTest, to deployment and hot code reloading.\n\nTalk objectives\n\n* Introduce developing embedded systems in Elixir using Nerves\n\n* Explore the Nerves development life-cycle\n\n* Demonstrate autonomous robotics using service discovery and messaging\n\n* Execute tests, create user interfaces with Phoenix, and perform hot code updates\n\nTarget audience\n\nCreating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature.

When the MER mission was approved in the year 2000, JPL researchers had already demonstrated that capability on prototype rovers [1] using software written primarily in C++ on a VxWorks realtime O/S platform with shared memory. So when asked to incorporate that capability into the MER vehicles which also relied on a similar VxWorks realtime O/S, the team concluded it would be safest and most expedient to incorporate the already field-tested C++ software. But that presented a challenge, since at that point all rover FSW development was mandated to be done mainly in the C programming language.\n\nIn this talk we present some of the challenges we faced and solutions we found in deploying C++ onto the Mars Rovers. For example, dynamic allocation was initially precluded, but development of a specialized memory allocator (using the C++ \"placement new\" operator) enabled us to incorporate it safely into the flight system. We will discuss what aspects of C++ were incorporated, what simulation environments aided development, describe some of the tools used to validate system behavior, and explain how our success using C++ for the implementation of autonomous navigation on MER has influenced future FSW efforts.\n\n[1] Jeffrey Biesiadecki, Mark W.

Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols?\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their \"good\", expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness. The designers' desire for more functionality has made these protocols effectively unsecurable.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0-days, and will show where to look for these 0-days.

Adherents of competing paradigms, such as functional and object-oriented programming, often appear motivated by faith. Families of related languages, such as C, C++, Java, and C#, may arise from pressures of evolution. As designers of languages, adoption rates provide us with scientific data, but the belief that elegant designs are better is a matter of faith. This talk traces one concept, second-order quantification, from its inception in the symbolic logic of Frege through to the generic features introduced in Java 5, touching on features of faith and evolution. The remarkable correspondence between natural deduction and functional programming informed the design of type classes in Haskell. Generics in Java evolved directly from Haskell type classes, and are designed to support evolution from legacy code to generic code. Links, a successor to Haskell aimed at AJAX-style three-tier web applications, aims to reconcile some of the conflict between dynamic and static approaches to typing.\n\nGoogle EngEDU\nSpeaker: Philip Wadler","id":"90f96115-56b1-45c7-aef1-3ff0ebc6762a","meta":{"duration":"PT1H6M54S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"faith-evolution-and-programming-languages","source":{"id":"8frGknO8rIg","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["googlevideo"],"title":"Faith, Evolution, and Programming Languages","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8frGknO8rIg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8frGknO8rIg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8frGknO8rIg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"The release of Java 8 brings several new features to the language.

'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.'

But finite state machines (FSMs) have real, practical value, and it is useful to know how to build and apply them in Clojure. For example, FSMs have long been popular to model game AIs and workflow rules, and FSMs provide the behind-the-scenes magic that powers Java's regexes and core.async's go blocks. In this talk, we'll look at two programming puzzles that, suprisingly, have very elegant solutions when looked at through the lens of FSMs, with code demonstrations using two different Clojure libraries for automata (automat and reduce-fsm), as well as loco, a Clojure constraint solver.\n\nAbout the speakers: Mark Engelberg has been an active member of the Clojure community ever since Clojure turned 1.0, and is the primary developer of math.combinatorics, math.numeric-tower, data.priority-map, ubergraph, and a co-developer of instaparse. By day, he teaches Scheme and Clojure to talented kids in the Seattle area; by night, he creates logic puzzles and games, using Clojure as his \"secret weapon\". His latest game is Code Master, a programming-themed puzzle game for kids, available exclusively at Target (and created with Clojure, of course!)\n\nAlex Engelberg was indoctrinated by his father in the ways of functional programming at a young age, and Clojure rapidly became his language of choice. He is happy to be using Clojure professionally as a software engineer at SecureOne in Seattle. Alex also enjoys contributing to open source; he is the primary developer of loco, and co-developer of instaparse.","id":"ca2e5a97-4b79-4da4-8b16-2244601a4d92","meta":{"duration":"PT38M4S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"solving-problems-with-automata-mark-engelberg-and-alex-engelberg","source":{"id":"AEhULv4ruL4","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["clojure","automata","finite state machines","Automata Theory","Computer Science (Field Of Study)"],"title":"Solving Problems with Automata - Mark Engelberg & Alex Engelberg","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AEhULv4ruL4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AEhULv4ruL4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AEhULv4ruL4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Day 1 - C++ has powerful rules for dealing with low-level program structure.

We'll also examine some of our past failures in this area, and how we think we can do better in upcoming releases.","id":"684a4e27-8af0-495f-a2b9-f91748bbb585","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4M32S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"lawful-asynchronous-programming-daniel-spiewak","source":{"id":"B0L91sW3XHw","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Scala (Programming Language)","asynchronicity"],"title":"Lawful Asynchronous Programming — Daniel Spiewak","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B0L91sW3XHw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B0L91sW3XHw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B0L91sW3XHw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Systems get bigger, technologies reach further, practices mature, advice changes... or at least some of it does. Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.","id":"cb34b6ad-7b24-42ca-95cf-e56a4663cbc3","meta":{"duration":"PT1H7M3S"},"presenter":{"name":"Kevlin Henney"},"slug":"small-is-beautiful","source":{"id":"B3b4tremI5o","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["GOTO","Keynote","GOTO Copenhagen","Scaling","Legacy System","Simplicity"],"title":"Small Is Beautiful","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Presenter(s): Rusty Russell\nURL: http://2011.linux.conf.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/190\n\nWhile working on CCAN I realised just how many C coding tricks there are.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \"Big Data\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","id":"41d84c92-b9a9-4509-88f2-eea8485608fa","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4M52S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft","source":{"id":"BeNrVl2_nyI","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Software Engineering (Industry)","Innovation (Quotation Subject)","Database (Software Genre)","DevOps","big data","pathways","adrian cockcroft","GOTO","GOTOcon","GOTO Conference","Adrian Cockcroft","Speed & Scale"],"title":"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nAsk a non-C++ developer what they think of C++ and they'll give the language plenty of compliments: powerful, fast, flexible, and \"the language for smart people\". But along with that you are likely to hear ugly, complicated, hard to read, and \"the language for smart people\". Is it possible to write beautiful C++? Not arcanely elegant or wickedly compact, but readable, clear, expressive - beautiful! We say it is, and we want to show you how.\n\nIn this session, you'll see how to turn pages of \"comic book characters swearing\" into code you'll be proud to call your own.

It helps a lot to acknowledge this and explicitly treat them as a part of your public API.

As Object Oriented methodologies gained popularity, MVC too gained traction as a natural and logical way to construct user interfaces despite obvious shortcomings. Even though OO researchers moved forward with alternative approaches likes Morphic and constraint based systems, MVC today maintains a stranglehold on mainstream developer approaches to UI.\n\nCan functional programming take the good lessons from MVC while advancing the state of the art? Functional Reactive Programming and its derivatives primarily solve complexities around events - what of component modularity and abstraction?\n\nWe'll examine how a new library for ClojureScript called Om, a simple functional layer over Facebook's React, makes some traditional hard problems in MVC based UIs simple without abandoning the abstractions OO programmers find so useful. These concepts are easily portable to other systems provided the presence of persistent data structures.","id":"8fcf0777-3a47-42a8-b15a-b490540f5a77","meta":{"duration":"PT27M2S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"david-nolen-the-functional-final-frontier","source":{"id":"DMtwq3QtddY","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["clojure","ClojureScript"],"title":"David Nolen - The Functional Final Frontier","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMtwq3QtddY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMtwq3QtddY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMtwq3QtddY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Javascript has always been a language with very little syntactic sugar—for better or worse. With ES6/2015, and future iterations,though, Javascript is gaining a more and more abstract and expressive syntax. To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners— is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners. As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.","id":"d7d4af9c-138f-4f59-840a-d031a79ca203","meta":{"duration":"PT25M49S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"ashley-williams-if-you-wish-to-learn-es62015-from-scratch-you-must-first-invent-the-universe","source":{"id":"DN4yLZB1vUQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Ashley Williams: If you wish to learn ES6/2015 from scratch, you must first invent the universe","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DN4yLZB1vUQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DN4yLZB1vUQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DN4yLZB1vUQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Jafar Husain discusses interesting features that can be used today in JS6, such as Object.observe, async functions and async generators, while also giving a peek at what's being explored for JS7 to make async programming easier.","id":"328a72f5-2625-4ad3-abd7-90dd168d9b94","meta":{"duration":"PT1H11M54S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"netflix-javascript-talks-version-7-the-evolution-of-javascript","source":{"id":"DqMFX91ToLw","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["netflix","JavaScript (Programming Language)","reactive programming","Web Development (Interest)","netflix ui engineering"],"title":"Netflix JavaScript Talks - Version 7: The Evolution of JavaScript","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqMFX91ToLw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqMFX91ToLw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqMFX91ToLw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"New York Times graphics editor, Jeremy Ashkenas, presents at Code Genius.\n\n4/23/15\n\nFollow Jeremy Ashkenas: @jashkenas\nwww.ashkenas.com\n\nVisit code.genius.com for more information about past events and upcoming talks\n\nPresented by Genius\nGENIUS.COM","id":"e07c7d75-818a-44ce-8dca-4b230ab025ab","meta":{"duration":"PT44M"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"code-genius-rise-of-the-transpilers-by-jeremy-ashkenas","source":{"id":"DspYurD75Ns","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"CODE GENIUS - Rise of the Transpilers by Jeremy Ashkenas","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DspYurD75Ns/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DspYurD75Ns/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DspYurD75Ns/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Keynote: New Heights by Chris McCord\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IDIZ/","id":"70c79cb1-5c08-44e2-810b-66d2671787b6","meta":{"duration":"PT48M43S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"elixirdaze-2016-keynote-new-heights-by-chris-mccord","source":{"id":"E6RTBlO9TZQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"ElixirDaze 2016 - Keynote: New Heights by Chris McCord","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6RTBlO9TZQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6RTBlO9TZQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E6RTBlO9TZQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"In object-oriented development, we are all familiar with design patterns such as the Strategy pattern and Decorator pattern, and design principles such as SOLID.

Poor code, however, is rarely arbitrary and random in its structure or formulation. Systems of code, well or poorly structured, emerge from systems of practice, whether effective or ineffective. To improve code quality, it makes more sense to pick apart the specific practices and see their interplay — the cause — than to simply focus on the code itself — the effect. This talk looks at how a handful of coding habits, design practices and assumptions can systematically balloon code and compound its accidental complexity.","id":"52f58a98-8e92-47cc-adcb-cb1d3726930b","meta":{"duration":"PT1H11M23S"},"presenter":{"name":"Kevlin Henney"},"slug":"clean-coders-hate-what-happens-to-your-code-when-you-use-these-enterprise-programming-tricks","source":{"id":"FyCYva9DhsI","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["NDC Conferences","Clean Code"],"title":"Clean Coders Hate What Happens to Your Code When You Use These Enterprise Programming Tricks","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FyCYva9DhsI/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FyCYva9DhsI/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FyCYva9DhsI/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Shannon -jj Behrens, Mike Solomon\nThis talk covers scalability at YouTube.

Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.\n\nA single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.\n\nBio\n----\nJean Yang (@jeanqasaur) is a final-year PhD student at MIT.

Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo.\n\nJohn McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","id":"9d97b648-ad8e-42f4-bfe2-420389637f94","meta":{"duration":"PT32M3S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"clojurescript-lisps-revenge-david-nolen","source":{"id":"MTawgp3SKy8","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Software","Software Development (Industry)","Programming Language (Literary Genre)","Clojure (Programming Language)","Lisp (Programming Language)","JavaSc","JavaScript (Programming Language)","ClojureScript","Conference","GOTO","Presentation (Software Genre)","Java Virtual Machine (Video Game Platform)","David Nolen","GOTOcon","GOTO Conference","Computer Science","Videos for Developers"],"title":"ClojureScript: Lisp's Revenge • David Nolen","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Dan Doel's talk at the Boston Haskell Meetup, Sept 17, 2014\nSlides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8Kkr1O1jFwcRmhxbzBMR1Ntb3c/edit?usp=sharing","id":"1cff0cdf-9d39-4722-8301-25d7bb4f676e","meta":{"duration":"PT1H9M40S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"dan-doel-introduction-to-low-level-haskell-optimization","source":{"id":"McFNkLPTOSY","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Haskell (Programming Language)"],"title":"Dan Doel - Introduction to Low Level Haskell Optimization","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/McFNkLPTOSY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/McFNkLPTOSY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/McFNkLPTOSY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Speaker: Craig Kerstiens\n\nTo many developers the database is a black box.

Nanopass frameworks are designed to help manage this complexity. A nanopass compiler is comprised of many single-task passes with formally defined intermediate languages. The nanopass compiler technique evolved from a methodology for teaching a compiler course at Indiana University, into a full-fledged framework, capable of implementing a replacement for the Chez Scheme compiler that runs on par with the original compiler. This talk will discuss the idea of a nanopass compiler and the implementation of a simple language using the framework in Chez Scheme, along with the challenges and opportunities of using these techniques in Clojure.\n\nAndy is a postdoc at the University of Utah, currently working on malware detection in Android Apps, using both Scala and miniKanren to write abstract analyzers in Matt Might's lab.

This project focused on replacing Chez Scheme's compiler with a nanopass compiler, along with his adviser R. Kent Dybvig.

We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design.

As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors.\nAfter thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted.\nThis talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos. I will give insights into how companies can still stay relevant even when software is free - and I will do this by looking at how windmills utterly disrupted landowners in 11th century Yorkshire.","id":"ca575fa9-e1bf-4720-9fed-655418466406","meta":{"duration":"PT46M33S"},"presenter":{"name":"Jamie Dobson"},"slug":"postcapitalism-jamie-dobson","source":{"id":"QgrChOltYek","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["GOTO Conference","Capitalism","Marx"],"title":"Postcapitalism","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QgrChOltYek/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong.

This is to C++'s excellent low-penalty abstractions and a memory model close to the machine.\n\nHowever, a large category of applications have no boundaries on desired speed, meaning there's no point of diminishing returns in making code faster. Better speed means less power consumed for the same work, more workload with the same data center expense, better features for the end user, more features for machine learning, better analytics, and more.\n\nOptimizing has always been an art, and in particular optimizing C++ on contemporary hardware has become a task of formidable complexity.

Wait, come back! In contrast to most systems programming languages (whose semantics can be quite esoteric), the semantics of a query (given some inputs) are precisely its outcome -- rows in tables. Hence when we write a query, we directly engage with its semantics: we simply say what we mean. This makes it easy and natural to reason about whether our queries are correct: that is, whether they mean what we intended them to mean.\n\nQuery languages have traditionally been applied to a relatively narrow domains: historically, data at rest in data stores; more recently, data in motion through continuous, \"streaming\" query frameworks. Why stop here? Could query languages do for a notoriously complex domain such as distributed systems programming what they have done so successfully for data management? How would they need to evolve to become expressive enough to capture the programs that we need to write, while retaining a simple enough semantics to allow mere mortals to reason about their correctness?\n\nI will attempt to answer these questions (and raise many others) by describing a query language for distributed programming called Dedalus. Like traditional query languages, Dedalus abstracts away many of the details we typically associate with programming, making data and time first-class citizens and relegating computation to a subordinate role, characterizing how data is allowed to change as it moves through space and time. As we will see, this shift allows programmers to directly reason about distributed correctness properties such as consistency and fault-tolerance, and lays the foundations for powerful program analysis and repair tools (such as Blazes and LDFI), as well as successive generations of data-centric programming languages (including Bloom, Edelweiss and Eve).\n\nPeter Alvaro\n\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ\n\n@palvaro\nPeter Alvaro is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Cruz. His research focuses on using data-centric languages and analysis techniques to build and reason about data-intensive distributed systems, in order to make them scalable, predictable and robust to the failures and nondeterminism endemic to large-scale distribution. Peter is the creator of the Dedalus language and co-creator of the Bloom language.\n\nWhile pursuing his PhD at while UC Berkeley, Peter co-developed and taught Programming the Cloud, an undergraduate course that explored distributed systems concepts through the lens of software development. Prior to attending Berkeley, Peter worked as a Senior Software Engineer in the data analytics team at Ask.com. Peter's principal research interests are databases, distributed systems and programming languages.","id":"fe90a49e-b429-40f1-b299-9ace12af7c15","meta":{"duration":"PT52M29S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"i-see-what-you-mean-by-peter-alvaro","source":{"id":"R2Aa4PivG0g","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"\"I See What You Mean\" by Peter Alvaro","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2Aa4PivG0g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2Aa4PivG0g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R2Aa4PivG0g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"The most tactile feel your users have of your site's performance is how it scrolls.

The history of these developments will be traced, and the much later place of Lambda Calculus in Mathematics and Programming-Language Theory will be outlined.","id":"2c504d89-3b94-45f6-b183-7fd5465c85d1","meta":{"duration":"PT30M8S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"lambda-calculus-then-and-now","source":{"id":"SphBW9ILVPU","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Calculus","Dana S.

Do they constantly second-guess themselves, checking for nil values, errors, and unexpected input? Even the cleanest Ruby codebases can become littered over time with nil checks, error handling, and other interruptions which steal attention away from the essential purpose of the code. This talk will discuss strategies for writing your Ruby classes and methods in a confident, straightforward style; without sacrificing functionality or robustness. In the process, we'll cover concepts and techniques points including: The narrative style of method construction The four parts of a method Three strategies for dealing with uncertain input Massaging input with coercion and the Decorator pattern Lightweight preconditions Exterminating nils from your code The chaining and iterative styles of method construction Eliminating conditionals with the Special Case and Null Object patterns Isolating errors with the Bouncer and Checked Method patterns","id":"d279df59-f2e3-4536-b965-325a4b2f8c37","meta":{"duration":"PT31M24S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"ruby-midwest-2011-confident-code-by-avdi-grimm","source":{"id":"T8J0j2xJFgQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["rubymidwest2011","Ruby (Programming Language)","Code"],"title":"Ruby Midwest 2011 Confident Code by Avdi Grimm","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"http://bit.ly/gAAXPd\n\nThis is the Apple Special Event 2011 which took place on 2nd March 2011\n\nThe iPad 2 is amazing!\n\nhttp://equimedia.blogspot.com/","id":"60957033-3814-44e2-a27d-b85fb940634b","meta":{"duration":"PT1H13M37S"},"presenter":{"name":"Steve Jobs"},"slug":"apple-ipad-2-keynote-special-event-march-2011","source":{"id":"TGxEQhdi1AQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Apple","Keynote"],"title":"Apple iPad 2 Keynote","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TGxEQhdi1AQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TGxEQhdi1AQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TGxEQhdi1AQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"We are the modern day scribes.

A multi-language, multi-target compiler infrastructure such as LLVM ameliorates the situation somewhat, but engineering fast, effective and correct optimizations for LLVM is challenging. Even after a decade of intense development, there is a long tail of unimplemented optimizations.\n\nUniversity of Utah Associate Professor John Regehr presents Souper, a superoptimizer that gives us a look at some of the optimizations that are missing from LLVM while also avoiding the bugs that are often found in hand-written optimization passes. Souper works by turning LLVM code into queries for an automated theorem prover. When Souper is run on LLVM itself, it identifies thousands of uncaught optimizations and also ranks them according to the likely improvement in code size or code speed that would result from implementing each one.\n\nJohn Regehr, Associate Professor, School of Computing, University of Utah\n\n12/2/2014\n\nhttps://www.cs.washington.edu/htbin-post/mvis/mvis?ID=2643\n\nhttp://uwtv.org","id":"6af7f393-cda8-4b61-8148-6fb71f7af619","meta":{"duration":"PT49M7S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"superoptimizing-llvm","source":{"id":"Ux0YnVEaI6A","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["UW","University of Washington","Engineering and Computer Science","optimization","superoptimizer","LLVM","Souper"],"title":"Superoptimizing LLVM","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ux0YnVEaI6A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ux0YnVEaI6A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ux0YnVEaI6A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"In this talk, the PTX back-end for LLVM will be discussed, including its' past, present, and future.

It wraps common patterns behind a friendly API for reading, writing, and processing data. We'll start with some fundamentals of the library and how it can enable you to work very close to raw data with ease. \n\nAfter an introduction to Okio, we will look at three libraries written with it: OkHttp, a modern HTTP client; Retrofit, a high-level HTTP wrapper; and Moshi, a brand new library for serialization. \n\nNot only are these libraries powerful on their own, but when combined their efficiency and performance dramatically increase. We'll conclude with demonstration of how to use them in your applications to great effect. \n\n- Jake Wharton\n\nAndroid developer for Square working on Square Cash.

In Idris, types are a first class language construct, meaning that they can be manipulated and computed like any other language construct. It encourages a type-driven style of development, in which programmers give types first and use interactive editing tools to derive programs. Introductory examples typically involve length-preserving operations on lists, or ordering invariants on sorting.\n\nRealistically, though, programming is not so simple: programs interact with users, communicate over networks, manipulate state, deal with erroneous input, and so on. In this talk I will show how advanced type systems allow us to express such interactions precisely, and how they support verification of stateful systems as a result.\n\nThe talk will include several examples, leading to a verified implementation of a word game (Hangman). I will show how Type-driven Development allows programmers to specify the game rules in a direct and concise style, and how it leads to an implementation, guaranteed to correctly follow the rules by typechecking.","id":"d4e21bb9-1552-4da5-afe1-a39e00a15697","meta":{"duration":"PT46M36S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"type-driven-development-in-idris-edwin-brady","source":{"id":"X36ye-1x_HQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Scala (Programming Language)","Idris (Programming Language)"],"title":"Type-Driven Development in Idris — Edwin Brady","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X36ye-1x_HQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X36ye-1x_HQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X36ye-1x_HQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Chris has been working with Drupal since 2006, and has experience of developing projects at all levels.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour \"Shifting the Burden\" and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself. Dan believes you can learn to recognise these coping mechanisms for what they are, and intends to set you on the path to simplicating your programming life. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","id":"4287947d-85e4-42a8-aa6a-34e4739d6e22","meta":{"duration":"PT55M31S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"kicking-the-complexity-habit-dan-north","source":{"id":"XqgwHXsQA1g","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Software As A Service (Industry)","Application Software (Software Genre)","Programming Language (Software Genre)","dan north","GOTO","GOTOcon","GOTO Conference","Programmer (Profession)","complexity"],"title":"Kicking the Complexity Habit • Dan North","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"\"Speaker: lvh\n\nA very brief introduction to the theory and practice of distributed systems.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015 and https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides\"","id":"81ca6acc-c85c-430f-8158-ec83de9ac880","meta":{"duration":"PT45M25S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"lvh-distributed-systems-101-pycon-2015","source":{"id":"YAFGQurdJ3U","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"lvh - Distributed Systems 101 - PyCon 2015","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAFGQurdJ3U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAFGQurdJ3U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAFGQurdJ3U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Building a Neural Network from Scratch by Karmen Blake\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IDEa/","id":"b9ff763b-465e-440f-88f9-e0f9f9f1e377","meta":{"duration":"PT32M27S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"elixirdaze-2016-learn-elixir-building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-by-karmen-blake","source":{"id":"YE0h9DURSOo","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"ElixirDaze 2016 - Learn Elixir: Building a Neural Network from Scratch by Karmen Blake","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YE0h9DURSOo/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YE0h9DURSOo/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YE0h9DURSOo/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":" ","id":"1c6e8723-d5b1-4db6-9397-87c02cff5dec","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4M35S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"the-algebra-of-algebraic-data-types","source":{"id":"YScIPA8RbVE","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["London","Haskell","Algebra","Algebraic","Types"],"title":"The Algebra of Algebraic Data Types","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YScIPA8RbVE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YScIPA8RbVE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YScIPA8RbVE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Matthew Flatt's talk at RacketCon 2013.","id":"b1c76e88-57a4-4e79-a904-2166137c406b","meta":{"duration":"PT48M48S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"racketcon-2013-matthew-flatt-a-dinosaurs-thoughts-on-programming-language-evolution","source":{"id":"Z9OYc1YYLT4","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Racket (Programming Language)","Evolution (Idea)"],"title":"RacketCon 2013: Matthew Flatt - A Dinosaur's Thoughts on Programming Language Evolution","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z9OYc1YYLT4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z9OYc1YYLT4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Z9OYc1YYLT4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Cody Roux's talk for the Boston Haskell Meetup - February 18, 2015\nSlides: http://www.slideshare.net/imalsogreg/cody-roux-pure-type-systems-boston-haskell-meetup","id":"c77fb625-3262-4d75-a397-1ef38989a4d5","meta":{"duration":"PT1H17M1S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"cody-roux-pure-type-systems","source":{"id":"ZGqKsalJi4s","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Haskell (Programming Language)"],"title":"Cody Roux - Pure Type Systems","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZGqKsalJi4s/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZGqKsalJi4s/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZGqKsalJi4s/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"The Cython compiler is the most widely used static compiler for Python.

As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law.\n\nOf course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is \"the Way\".\n\nDr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9.\n\nThis video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation.

This is not only a question of writing parallel algorithms, but also a matter of designing the application properly to reduce inter-thread dependencies. These dependencies may be very hard to find and are the results of decades of serial programming. Thus, writing truly scalable software is less a question of technical expertise than adopting the appropriate state of mind.\n\nThis presentation is about the design, techniques and tools used by the team who wrote the hyperscalable database \"quasardb.\" Building upon concrete scalability challenges, the presenter will expose typical multithreading anti-patterns and how to avoid them.

To manage this complexity and build larger applications and systems, C++ strives to form emergent structures (often found in nature, such as snowflakes' symmetrical structures), where simple patterns combine to form a remarkably complex and powerful system. These structures provide both a means to limit the complexity of each component and the essential economies of scale we rely on when developing software.\n\nFrom handheld devices to warehouse-sized data centers, motivated by smaller devices and increased concerns over power consumption, we are relying upon C++ to deliver these complex systems with unmatched efficiency. Our optimizing compilers today are more important than ever before and are utterly opaque to most practicing programmers. Compounding matters, the very emergent structures which allow C++ systems to scale for humans often provide unique and unsolved challenges to optimization.\n\nIn this talk, I will start with a brief overview of how modern optimizing compilers work with C++ code at a very high level. I will then walk through the specific structures and patterns of C++ code, which are at the core of forming emergent structures out of simple, elegant elements. I will also address how these interactions can be effectively modeled and analyzed by a compiler to produce efficient final programs. All of this will be illustrated by a collection of real world case studies, which are broadly applicable and show up throughout modern C++ code bases. My goal is to give a framework for understanding these interactions both in the C++ code and the optimizing compiler, so that programmers are aware of the implications posed by these patterns. Finally, I will introduce a set of principles and techniques for designing and implementing C++ programs and libraries to specifically clear the way for modern optimizers while retaining the simplicity of each component and the power of the combined whole.","id":"db6c2351-e8d3-43ce-98a6-5105d5f525b5","meta":{"duration":"PT1H33M2S"},"presenter":{"name":"Chandler Carruth"},"slug":"optimizing-the-emergent-structures-of-c","source":{"id":"eR34r7HOU14","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["c++now","Boostcon","keynote"],"title":"Optimizing the Emergent Structures of C++","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eR34r7HOU14/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eR34r7HOU14/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eR34r7HOU14/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"If you don't know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you!

It is not uncommon that innocuous high-level artifacts have a surprisingly high impact on the bottom line of an application's run time (and power consumed).\n\nThis talk is an attempt to set forth a few pieces of tactical advice for writing quick code in C++. Applying these is not guaranteed to produce optimal code, but is likely to put it reasonably within the ballpark. \n\nThese tips are based on practical experience but also motivated by the inner workings of modern CPUs.","id":"f469f9a7-07f1-4fd9-b95d-0b30f2b8ba00","meta":{"duration":"PT1H11M37S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"writing-quick-code-in-c-quickly","source":{"id":"ea5DiCg8HOY","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["c++","goingnative","goingnative 2013"],"title":"Writing Quick Code in C++, Quickly","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ea5DiCg8HOY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ea5DiCg8HOY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ea5DiCg8HOY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"How did our industry start, what paths did it take to get to where we are, and where is it going.

There is a good chance it is in part because of concerns about the performance of your software. Whether they stem from needing to run on every smaller mobile devices, squeezing the last few effects into video game, or because every watt of power in your data center costs too much, C++ programmers throughout the industry have an insatiable desire for writing high performance code.\n\nUnfortunately, even with C++, this can be really challenging. Over the past twenty years processors, memory, software libraries, and even compilers have radically changed what makes C++ code fast. Even measuring the performance of your code can be a daunting task. This talk will dig into how modern processors work, what makes them fast, and how to exploit them effectively with modern C++ code. It will teach you how modern C++ optimizers see your code today, and how that is likely to change in the coming years. It will teach you how to reason better about the performance of your code, and how to write your code so that it performs better. You will even learn some tricks about how to measure the performance of your code.\n--\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative style.\n\n In realizing this vision, we develop algebras for visual presentation and for \"deep\" function application, where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples, functions, etc. Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations.\n\n\nSpeaker: Conal Elliott\nMost of my research is aimed at supporting the creation of interactive synthetic media content, including computer animation, human-computer interaction, images, 2D and 3D geometry, and programmable shaders. In all cases, I aim to preserve or improve on the flexibility and performance of mainstream programming approaches, while greatly simplifying the creation process.\n\nSynthetic media programs are almost always implemented in sequential, imperative (often object-oriented) languages. My research explores use of declarative languages, resulting in much simpler and more reusable and composable programs. These languages are also more amenable to execution on parallel architectures such as modern graphics processors, because declarative languages abstract away from order of execution, removing the accidental sequentiality found in imperative programs. Even on sequential machines, declarative formulations have much simpler mathematical semantics, which facilitates automatic optimization. They also tend to be spatially and temporally continuous (resolution-independent), allowing them to adapt naturally to machines with different speeds and display resolutions.\n\nAfter exploring explicit programming of synthetic media content for several years, I'm now also keenly interested in supporting artists. The goal of my new new research agenda is to give artists access to the expressive power of computers and programming languages, while retaining an artist's working style. I mean \"artist\" in a broad sense, in contrast to the verbal and sequential style of an engineer.  (I don't mean to suggest that people fit neatly into these two categories.)

Invention requires a significantly higher investment of money, much longer time frames, and a different approach to problem solving.","id":"3ed26e02-40d4-4704-8f58-bc7e9de6b6b0","meta":{"duration":"PT43M50S"},"presenter":{"name":"Alan Kay"},"slug":"the-future-doesnt-have-to-be-incremental","source":{"id":"gTAghAJcO1o","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Inspiring","DEMO Conference 2014"],"title":"The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTAghAJcO1o/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTAghAJcO1o/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTAghAJcO1o/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Many people are quick to dismiss ClojureScript as a web development language. \"It has some neat ideas\", they might say, \"but it's easier to just use JavaScript for all that\".

In other words, Racket is designed to support the creation of programming languages which can then be used to build programs. Using Racket, we have built program languages ranging from large, general-purpose languages matching particular programming paradigms to small, specialized programming languages designed for just a single file in some larger program.\n\nIn this talk, I will bring across how it feels to program in such a language, discuss some of the technical support Racket has to make such programming practical, and show how Racket’s standard libraries have embraced this perspective, enabling us to include lots of batteries.\n\nRobby is an associate professor of computer science at Northwestern University and received his PhD from Rice University in 2002.

Currently, to create an interactive diagram one must write code to procedurally draw the diagram and respond appropriately to user input. Writing this code can take hours or days. Apparatus aims to reduce the time to create an interactive diagram from hours to minutes.\n\nApparatus combines the direct manipulation capabilities of a vector graphics editor with the dataflow capabilities of a spreadsheet. Through this hybridization, Apparatus supports both spatial and symbolic ways of working in tandem. Dataflow defines the state space of a diagram, algebra driving geometry. Dragging shapes moves through this state space, geometry driving algebra. Instead of function calls or object-oriented inheritance, Apparatus uses a \"call by copying\" pattern for diagram reuse. Reused diagrams do not need to be explicitly parameterized. Instead of loops, Apparatus uses spreads which allow any value to exist in a \"superposition\". This allows shapes to be looped over implicitly. By decomposing shapes into paths of points, it also enables Apparatus to plot curves.\n\nToby Schachman\nCOMMUNICATIONS DESIGN GROUP\n\nToby Schachman is an artist and interaction designer interested in new ways of seeing.

The idea never went beyond its seminal stage. In the present study I try to make it less fuzzy by relating it to the ontologically interpreted category theory, where \"ontological interpretation\" should be understood \"in the sense of Quine\". Roughly speaking, the ontology in the sense of Quine does not aspire to establish what does exist, but rather what a given theory or doctrine assumes there exists. To construct such an ontology, one should paraphrase a given doctrine into the first order logical calculus and look for those variables that are bound by the existential quantifiers. Only those entities that correspond to such variables are postulated to exist. However, in principle each topos has its own \"internal logic\". Consequently, we should apply Quine's program to each such category individually (by employing its own internal logic), and speak about the ontology in the sense of Quine characteristic for a given category in terms of a given logical calculus (if Quine's program is realisable in this logic). However, the Quine ontological program does not directly refer to the internal logic of a given theory, but rather to the logic with the help of which we are interpreting this theory (the external or meta-logic), and this is expected to be the standard classical logic. This is also the case with respect to category theory. When developing this theory, for instance by proving theorems, we are using standard logical laws of inference. This is why we seem entitled to ontologically interpret category theory strictly following Quine's recipe (i.e. with the help of the first order logical calculus), but we should be aware that this could be conditioned by the fact that our brain is a macroscopic object embedded into the world having the ontology characteristic for the category of sets. Having these caveats in mind I sketch \"ontological commitments\" of category theory and briefly signal some underlying philosophical problems.\n\n***\n\nThis talk was delivered during the conference ���The Limits of Physics and Cosmology” organized by Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies.\n\nThere exist various kinds of limits which are inherent in cosmological research and physics.\n\nThe most conspicuous one is connected with scientific method itself. It manifests itself during attempts to construct (or discover) suitable mathematical structures to model the physical world. However, this limit may be even more profound. Over the past 300 years we have become accustomed to the mathematical and empirical method which has proven to be uncannily successful in describing the enclosing universe. But is there a fundamental limit to the method itself which is intrinsic to the structure of the world?\n\nAnother group of limits which are more connected to ourselves – as human beings – are conceptual ones. The two monumental theories of physics of the 20th century – General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics - are incompatible and this inconsistency is not only on the mathematical level, but also on the conceptual. Usually scientists believe that the reconciliation between the relativist and quantum realms is possible. But is there a conceptual limit within ourselves as elements of the world?","id":"7536514a-ff9f-430c-8e2f-7442ed35aaba","meta":{"duration":"PT44M7S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"field-of-rationality-and-category-theory-michal-heller","source":{"id":"jjfE2jTAQrE","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Centrum Kopernika Badań Interdyscyplinarnych","Centrum Kopernika","Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies","Copernicus Center","Kraków","Michael Heller (Award Winner)","Category Theory (Field Of Study)","Mathematics (Field Of Study)","Physics (Field Of Study)","Theory (Quotation Subject)","Philosophy (Field Of Study)","Józef Życiński (Deceased Person)"],"title":"Field of Rationality and Category Theory, Michał Heller","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjfE2jTAQrE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjfE2jTAQrE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjfE2jTAQrE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Large Scale JavaScript Application Architecture  \nTime: Wednesday @ 10:40am | Room E-131\nhttp://html5devconf.com/index.html     #HTML5DevConf\n\nLearn how to build your team and technology without losing development time.

However, it does not provide good mechanisms for manipulating combinations of those values: like a map of sequences of maps of maps. Code that aims to manipulate these nested data structures complects navigation code with the desired query or transformation. Code like this is painful to write and ugly to read.\n\nSpecter is a library that makes querying and transformation of nested data structures simple, easy, and efficient. At its core it abstracts away the concept of data structure navigation and makes these navigations highly composable. Specter can manipulate any of Clojure's maps, sequences, records, and sets, and by hooking into Specter's protocols you can use it to manipulate any data structure. On top of all this, Specter is highly performant: for example, Specter's equivalent to update-in runs 5x faster.

How do you tune your C++ code and achieve the necessary performance metrics?\n\nThis talk will walk through the process of tuning C++ code from benchmarking to performance analysis. It will focus on small scale performance problems ranging from loop kernels to data structures and algorithms. It will show you how to write benchmarks that effectively measure different aspects of performance even in the face of advanced compiler optimizations and bedeviling modern CPUs. It will also show how to analyze the performance of your benchmark, understand its behavior as well as the CPUs behavior, and use a wide array of tools available to isolate and pinpoint performance problems. The tools and some processor details will be Linux and x86 specific, but the techniques and concepts should be broadly applicable.\n--\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

This talk focuses on what C++11 and C++14 offers to simplify programming: auto, range-for loops, move semantics, futures, concepts, and more. However, the focus is not primarily on language features: the key is programming: how can we write better, more readable, efficient, and more maintainable code? If you think that the essence of C++ is clever pointer manipulation and huge class hierarchies you may be in for a few surprises.","id":"d42ee48e-77ad-429a-bce2-f5e716b2ea6f","meta":{"duration":"PT1H37M36S"},"presenter":{"name":"Bjarne Stroustrup"},"slug":"make-simple-tasks-simple","source":{"id":"nesCaocNjtQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["CppCon","Simplicity"],"title":"Make Simple Tasks Simple!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nesCaocNjtQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Read more information here: http://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/mathematics-lectures-for-software-engineers-category-theory-by-tom-lagatta\n\nFilmed at the March 11, 2014 LispNYC meetup at Meetup HQ in NYC.","id":"8e780281-16bc-4fbe-895f-a874d3ebacac","meta":{"duration":"PT1H36M54S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"category-theory-by-tom-lagatta","source":{"id":"o6L6XeNdd_k","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Category Theory by Tom LaGatta","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6L6XeNdd_k/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6L6XeNdd_k/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o6L6XeNdd_k/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Classes are great but they are also overused.

Elixir and Phoenix can leverage the 30 years head-start of the underlying Erlang platform, but for newcomers to the platform it is not always easy to find and apply Erlang best practices. This talk explores some specific security-related aspects of Elixir, Phoenix and the Erlang VM, through practical demonstrations and use-cases. Topics covered include: use of Erlang's 'ssl' module, distributed Erlang, and VM hardening against DoS attacks.\n\nTalk objectives\n\nThe purpose of this talk is to make people familiar with some of the Erlang/Elixir specific security considerations. It is focussed on those things that may surprise people coming to Elixir from other languages, and therefore skims over common attack patterns (XSS, CSRF, SQLI, etc.) and their mitigations.\n\nTarget audience\n\nAnyone planning to deploy an Elixir application, with or without experience in deployment/security using other languages/platforms.\n\n\nBram is a system architect and security advocate at Cisco Systems. His work focusses on massively concurrent back-end systems for IoT/IoE applications, preferably built using Erlang/Elixir, as well as PKI-based security solutions for such environments.

In Paul's words, \"Based on my extensive experience with Scala collections, I'm writing my own. The focus is much tighter: immutable, performant, predictable, correct. The talk will alternate between why the Scala collections manage none of those things, and how I hope to do better.\"\n\nA day after the SF Scala event, Paul left this comment on their meetup page, which seems relevant, \"[...] I already discovered that if I say nothing about it then people will draw very incorrect conclusions about what the major issues are and why I've moved on.

They are simple high order functions agnostic of the notion of iterator or collection and can be combined by simple function composition. They can later be applied eagerly or lazily over iterators, but most interestingly, also to other kinds of \"reactive\" sources, like networked streams, inter-process channels or reactive observables (e.g. RxCpp). Not only they provide an elegant decoupling between the \"what\" and the \"how\" and higher level of reuse, their implementation is often simpler and and more performant than similar boost::range adaptors.\n\nTransducers were introduced in Clojure by Rich Hickey. At Ableton we implemented them in C++ and released them as part of our Open Source modern C++ toolkit: Atria. Our implementation introduces innovations of its own, like implementing state-full transducers without mutation, enabling further safety and reusability. We also use Eric Niebler's technique to describe and check its concepts in standard compliant C++11.\n\nIn this session we will introduce the concept of transducers and how they can be implemented in modern C++.","id":"d5804b50-afd0-4d40-90e9-3b759a3b921b","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4S"},"presenter":{"name":"Juan Pedro Bolívar Puente"},"slug":"transducers-from-clojure-to-c","source":{"id":"vohGJjGxtJQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Clojure","CppCon 2015"],"title":"Transducers: from Clojure to C++","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vohGJjGxtJQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vohGJjGxtJQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vohGJjGxtJQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Curry On Prague, July 7th, 2015\nhttp://curry-on.org\nhttp://2015.ecoop.org","id":"ad2bb66e-b1ef-4aa6-b728-6c4e55667941","meta":{"duration":"PT44M"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"cliff-click-bits-of-advice-for-vm-writers-curry-on","source":{"id":"vzzABBxo44g","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Cliff Click - Bits of advice for VM writers - Curry On","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzzABBxo44g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzzABBxo44g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vzzABBxo44g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Juan Manuel Santos - Salting things up in the sysadmin's world\n[EuroPython 2015]\n[21 July 2015]\n[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]\n\nSaltStack is a thriving configuration management system written in\nPython that leverages YAML and Jinja2 which, by now, probably needs no\nintroduction.\n\nThis talk will cover a brief summary of why we need configuration\nmanagement tools, followed by a full dive into SaltStack, its\nfeatures, pros and cons, how to use it and how to extend it.

It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nAstrophysicist and Software Architect Brian Beckman interviews Rich Hickey to dig into the details of this very interesting language. If you don't know much about Clojure and the general problems it aims to solve, well, watch and listen carefully to this great conversation with plenty of whiteboarding and outstanding questions.

And this is fair; there's no better way to make you feel pitifully mainstream than throwing category theory at you. Conversely, JS programmers tend to believe functional programming, therefore, can have no real world application because nobody in the real world has any idea what a Yoneda lemma is and they seem to be getting by just fine without it.\n\nExcept we aren't.

And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming. To demonstrate, I'll attempt to write a browser based game, from scratch, with ponies, using RxJS, everybody's favourite reactive library, live on stage in 30 minutes with no callback hell in sight.

Sadly, this means we're all basically stuck in an abusive relationship with JavaScript. Obviously not a desirable position to find ourselves in, we've tried breaking out of the JS trap in a variety of ways: JS dialects (solving no design flaws but at least looking prettier) and JS as a compilation target (resulting, mostly, in unappealingly large output to support the emulated runtimes).\nSo when I found myself having to build a system with real deliverable size constraints, my only options seemed to be JS itself, or TypeScript, which doesn't add much to JS but at least provides a modicum of type checking. After a few months of fighting TypeScript, though, I'd had enough. Happily, my frustration coincided with the advent of PureScript.\nAt first glance, PureScript looks and feels like Haskell, but there's hardly any extraneous machinery. The PureScript compiler generates very concise JS, and the language itself is designed with the platform's constraints in mind. Yet it offers things like higher kinded polymorphism, type classes and similar deep Haskell magic. More appealingly, it comes with a growing number of libraries for coping with the browser as a platform: functional DOM manipulation, reactive programming, and more.\nIt turned out to be a delight, getting out of my tangled mess of JavaScript and rebuilding it all in PureScript, and I'd like to show you how and why. \n\nby Bodil Stokke (@bodil) - Future Ad Labs\n\nBodil is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she's still learning how to stop.

In the modern day, it is more common to think of language modeling as an exercise in probabilistic inference from data: we observe how words and combinations of words are used, and from that build computer models of what the phrases mean. This approach is hopeless with a small amount of data, but somewhere in the range of millions or billions of examples, we pass a threshold, and the hopeless suddenly becomes effective, and computer models sometimes meet or exceed human performance. This talk gives examples of the data available in large repositories of text, images, and videos, and shows some tasks that can be accomplished with the resulting models.","id":"0702d9aa-888d-4a61-a96c-ea9e8a7d66d9","meta":{"duration":"PT1H2M57S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"peter-norvig-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-data","source":{"id":"yvDCzhbjYWs","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["UBC","Computer","Science","CPSC","Distinguished","Lecture","Series","DLS","Peter","Norvig","PeterNorvig"],"title":"Peter Norvig - The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvDCzhbjYWs/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvDCzhbjYWs/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvDCzhbjYWs/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"Videos from DjangoCon Europe 2013 are kindly provided by Heroku, a cloud application platform -- a new way of building and deploying web apps: http://heroku.com/","id":"bcf18091-ba24-4b06-8476-0ebf25f5887d","meta":{"duration":"PT31M10S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"djangocon-eu-2013-brandon-rhodes-keynote","source":{"id":"yvMWUGx7Fx8","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["djangocon","djangocon europe 2013","djangocon europe","python","heroku","keynote","brandon rhodes"],"title":"DjangoCon EU 2013: Brandon Rhodes - Keynote","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvMWUGx7Fx8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvMWUGx7Fx8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvMWUGx7Fx8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":null,"id":"6ea43f7a-b39d-42b5-a129-6d88a2ffc659","meta":{"duration":"PT44M24S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"brandon-rhodes-oh-come-on-who-needs-bytearrays-pycon-2015","source":{"id":"z9Hmys8ojno","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Brandon Rhodes - Oh, Come On Who Needs Bytearrays - PyCon 2015","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9Hmys8ojno/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9Hmys8ojno/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z9Hmys8ojno/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"We're all pretty big fans of Bootstrap. It's a component library that helps us turn our ideas into reality faster than we've ever been able to do in the past. Unfortunately, it's kind of bland (on purpose!), and all the sites on the internet are starting to look the same. At Stripe, we wanted the same power of being able to spin up projects quickly, but without using Bootstrap, specifically. So we made \"Bootstripe\". It's able to be much more opinionated, and allows lots of parallel developers to build consistent user interfaces. I'd love to tell you how to build your own, how to test it, and how to integrate it into your applications.\n\nhttps://jsconfar.com","id":"b30c39d2-201f-48cc-afa8-7d6ab7f42c17","meta":{"duration":"PT20M4S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"alex-sexton-your-very-own-component-library-or-jsconfar-2014","source":{"id":"zSYo7m5kGHQ","provider":"youtube"},"tag":[],"title":"Alex Sexton: Your Very Own Component Library | JSConf.ar 2014","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSYo7m5kGHQ/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSYo7m5kGHQ/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zSYo7m5kGHQ/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}},{"description":"We’ve come a long way in the last 20 years. We start our journey in the late 80s and our \"discovery\" of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession.
