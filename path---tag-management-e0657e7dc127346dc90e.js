By the\nend of this talk you will have gone from knowing little or nothing\nabout SaltStack, to being able to deploy your own setup.\n\nThis talk will be targeted to either seasoned Python developers who\nare taking their first steps in the system administration world, or\nestablished system administrators who secretly love Python and prefer\nto stay away of configuration management systems based on other\nlanguages.\nIts advisable that attendees have some familiarity with Python as well\nas with system administration concepts.
