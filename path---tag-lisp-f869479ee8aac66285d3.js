This hallowed tradition is described in detail in \"Lisp in Small Pieces,\" the seminal work on the making of Lisps, but everybody loves a tl;dr, so let's do the 40 minute executive summary.\n\nWe'll charge at high speed\nthrough the following topics, with Clojure code to follow along with as we go (because there's no better language for implementing a Lisp than another Lisp):\n\n* Parsing: turning text files into ASTs\n* Fundamental Lisp datatypes\n* McCarthy's elementary functions\n* Evaluating Lisp code\n* Lambdas and lexical scope\n* Your friend, the state monad\n* Beyond Lisp: pattern matching and type systems\n\nWhen we're done, you'll be ready to go forth and fill the world with Lisps of all shapes, colours and Greenspun violations for Great Justice. Also, it'll be good fun.\n\nSpeaker\nBodil Stokke (@bodil) is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of three annual developer conferences in her home\ntown of Oslo, Norway, mostly because she's still learning how to stop.
