It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.",meta:{duration:"PT40M12S"},presenter:{name:null},slug:"convex-optimization-in-julia",source:{id:"SoI0lEaUvTs",provider:"youtube"},tag:["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"],title:"Convex Optimization in Julia"},allTalkJson:null},pathContext:{slug:"convex-optimization-in-julia",tags:["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"]}}}});
