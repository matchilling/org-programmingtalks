Sometimes the best library design is based on a pattern that's very familiar to a Haskell programmer but alien to a C++ programmer. The new std::future proposal for C++17 hides several functional patterns including that of a monad -- the boogeyman of generations of imperative programmers. But once seen in action, the monad becomes just one more pattern in the toolbox of a library designer. \nBio\nBartosz Milewski always tries to be where the action is. He started as a quantum physicist when supertstrings were hot, joined the software industry to build the search engine for Microsoft Windows, became an avid proponent of object-oriented programming, and wrote a book on C++. He got into concurrency and parallelism when the multicores hit the market, and now he's evangelizing functional programming as the Holy Grail of software development.",meta:{duration:"PT1H20M59S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BFnhhPehpKw",provider:"youtube"},slug:"c17-i-see-a-monad-in-your-future",tag:["NWCPP","Bartosz Milewski","Monad","functional programming","Haskel","futures","promise","design patterns","software development","concurrent programming","parallell programming"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFnhhPehpKw/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"C++17: I See a Monad in Your Future"}},{node:{description:"In this video tutorial, Dan Rosen will show you how to use Scala's capacity for monadic design to eliminate repetitive boilerplate in your code.
