It can be used for any conceivable application - not just telecom. It has a multi-decade track record of success. So why does it remain a niche technology?\n\nTo answer this question, Garrett turned to science. He conducted a detailed survey across a wide spectrum of programmers, architects, and managers to gather data on this question. In this talk, Garrett will present his findings and reflect on what they could mean for Erlang and its community.\n\nErlang adoption is important. It makes your job easier when Erlang is supported by your company and customers. It's easier to grow teams when there are more Erlang programmers. The language itself will improve as it is applied across more domains. If you're interested in this topic - and want data rather than personal opinions - join Garrett in this important discussion.\n\nTalk objectives:\n\n- To present data to better understand how Erlang is used and, more importantly, how and why Erlang is not used.\n\nTarget audience:\n\n- Anyone interested in supporting and promoting Erlang adoption, either within their company or within the broader programming community.",meta:{duration:"PT51M55S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"3MvKLOecT1I",provider:"youtube"},slug:"garrett-smith-why-the-cool-kids-dont-use-erlang",tag:["Erlang","Erlang User Conference","Garrett Smith"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3MvKLOecT1I/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Garrett Smith - Why The Cool Kids Don't Use Erlang"}},{node:{description:"PBT with tools like QuickCheck and Proper are quite powerful, but building the models to test against is still probably the hardest part.
