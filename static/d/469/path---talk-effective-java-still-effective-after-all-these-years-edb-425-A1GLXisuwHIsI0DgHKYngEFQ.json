We will discuss how these tools work and why frameworks like Spring use them. You will learn enough to begin integrating these frameworks directly into your own code.","meta":{"duration":"PT55M1S"},"presenter":{"name":"Ashley Puls"},"source":{"id":"39kdr1mNZ_s","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"living-in-the-matrix-with-bytecode-manipulation","tag":["Spring Framework","Java"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/39kdr1mNZ_s/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Living in the Matrix with Bytecode Manipulation"}},{"node":{"description":"This talk speculates about the next language after JavaScript, and what to do in the mean time about some of the new features in ES6.\nThere will be an emphasis on simplicity and quality.

Lately, we are seeing an explosion in JVM languages. This is partly, but not only, because of Java 7, the first JVM to ship with invokedynamic, which is a quantum leap in polyglot runtime implementation. This session explains why emerging language implementations are becoming more common and more feasible to implement on the JVM with satisfactory performance. It tells you how we got there and walks through the technology already in place (such as invokedynamic) and that which is in progress. The future for the JVM is bright indeed.

The big evolution of course is the lambda expressions.

In addition to looking at lambdas we will also dive into the Streams capabilities and also some of the features in Java 8 that make all these possible.","meta":{"duration":"PT1H25M27S"},"presenter":{"name":"Venkat Subramaniam"},"source":{"id":"j9nj5dTo54Q","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"java-8-language-capabilities-whats-in-it-for-you","tag":["Spring Framework","Java"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j9nj5dTo54Q/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Java 8 Language Capabilities, What's in it for you?"}},{"node":{"description":"JVMLS 2015 - Multi-Language Runtime - Mark Stoodley\n\nThe JVM Language Summit is an open technical collaboration among language designers, compiler writers, tool builders, runtime engineers, and VM architects.
