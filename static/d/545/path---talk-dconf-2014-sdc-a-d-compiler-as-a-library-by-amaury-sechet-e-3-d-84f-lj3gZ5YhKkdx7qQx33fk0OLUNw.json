Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website. Once again - thank you all for creating the first edition of Atmosphere Conference and see you next year.","meta":{"duration":"PT51M26S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"C4z_9F6nfS8","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"atmosphere-2013-your-css-is-a-mess-jonathan-snook-shopify","tag":["atmosphere","conference","2013","allegro","allegrogroup","cisco systems","cisco","dell","akamai","akamai technologies","performance","scalability","devops","web","java","javascript","css","http","developer","programming","tdd","data","john paul","conde nast"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4z_9F6nfS8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Atmosphere 2013: \"Your CSS is a Mess\" Jonathan Snook (Shopify)"}},{"node":{"description":"Build Your Own Lisp for Great Justice\n\nImplementing a toy Lisp interpreter is practically a rite of passage for the budding computer scientist. This hallowed tradition is described in detail in \"Lisp in Small Pieces,\" the seminal work on the making of Lisps, but everybody loves a tl;dr, so let's do the 40 minute executive summary.\n\nWe'll charge at high speed\nthrough the following topics, with Clojure code to follow along with as we go (because there's no better language for implementing a Lisp than another Lisp):\n\n* Parsing: turning text files into ASTs\n* Fundamental Lisp datatypes\n* McCarthy's elementary functions\n* Evaluating Lisp code\n* Lambdas and lexical scope\n* Your friend, the state monad\n* Beyond Lisp: pattern matching and type systems\n\nWhen we're done, you'll be ready to go forth and fill the world with Lisps of all shapes, colours and Greenspun violations for Great Justice. Also, it'll be good fun.\n\nSpeaker\nBodil Stokke (@bodil) is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of three annual developer conferences in her home\ntown of Oslo, Norway, mostly because she's still learning how to stop. She is a prolific contributor to the Free Software community, primarily as a Clojure developer, and has recently taken up designing new programming languages as a hobby. In her spare time, she works as a web developer for Comoyo, which is like Hulu for non-Americans.","meta":{"duration":"PT53M52S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"DHubfS8E--o","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"functional-programming-bodil-stokke","tag":["programming","lisp","geek","functional","clojure"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DHubfS8E--o/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Functional programming - Bodil Stokke"}},{"node":{"description":"Higgs, a JIT compiler for JavaScript written in D, was presented at DConf 2013. Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining. We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in the Higgs implementation.","meta":{"duration":"PT43M57S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"FGgFMZhnXvU","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"dconf-2014-day-2-talk-2-refactoring-jit-compilation-by-maxime-chevalier-boisvert","tag":["Compiler (Software Genre)","Just In Time","optimization","javascript","compilation","jit","dconf","higgs","conference","talk","Just-in-time Compilation"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGgFMZhnXvU/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"DConf 2014 Day 2 Talk 2: Refactoring JIT Compilation by Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert"}},{"node":{"description":"Learn from John Papa's talk \"10 AngularJS Patterns\" from Code on the Beach 2014 at One Ocean Resort & Spa, Atlantic Beach, Florida.

As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law.\n\nOf course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is \"the Way\".\n\nDr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9.\n\nThis video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation. Of course, you can't just cover monads in a vacuum (category theory is not really addressed here) so the context is functional programming (Brian covers functions and composable functional structures (function chains) and of course monoids and then monads).\n\nTune in. There's a lot to learn here and only Brian can make monads easy to understand for the rest of us!","meta":{"duration":"PT1H7M11S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"ZhuHCtR3xq8","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"brian-beckman-dont-fear-the-monad","tag":["haskell","monads","programming","brian beckman","functional programming","Haskell"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZhuHCtR3xq8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Brian Beckman: Don't fear the Monad"}},{"node":{"description":"Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/220902753/\nPaper: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Strachey67.pdf\nSlides: http://bit.ly/1BnBb08\nAudio: http://bit.ly/1HAdXci\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSponsored by Two Sigma (@twosigma) and The Ladders (@TheLaddersDev)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription\n---------------\nStrachey's lectures on \"Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages\" provided an extremely broad survey of core issues in programming language design that provided much of the terminology we use today, including definitions of the kinds of polymorphism and the kinds of expressions we see in programming languages.

Check us out at http://engineering.cerner.com/ and @CernerEng\n\nAt most companies, advanced analytics expertise is contained in a lab environment: a small team of analysts sitting at their computers and churning out reports and insights to support business decisions. But the real impact from advanced analytics comes from building models that make real-time decisions within production workflows. We will discuss how to use the ecosystem of technologies around Hadoop to support bringing models out of the lab and into the factory, with a focus on strategies for data integration, large-scale machine learning, and experimentation.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nJosh Wills (@josh_wills) is the Senior Director of Data Science at Cloudera, a leading distrubtor of Hadoop and related services.
