These include, among others: - object lifetime/ownership - how to make classes from different class hierarchies conform to a common interface - writing classes that can present multiple interfaces - separating interface and implementation - how to write virtual functions so that subclasses override them properly - the virtual inheritance \"diamond of death\"\n\nProper use of type erasure can mitigate, or outright eliminate, these and other problems, without sacrificing performance.\n\nThis talk will cover the OOP design problems above and more, and will cover hand-rolled and library-based type erasure approaches that solve those problems. Performance metrics will be provided for the different approaches, and source code will be available after the talk.\n--\nZach Laine has been using C++ in industry for 11 years, focusing on data visualization, numeric computing, games, generic programming, and good library design. He finds the process of writing bio blurbs to be a little uncomfortable.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com","meta":{"duration":"PT43M47S"},"presenter":{"name":"Zach Laine"},"source":{"id":"0I0FD3N5cgM","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"pragmatic-type-erasure-solving-oop-problems-with-elegant-design-pattern","tag":["CppCon 2014"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0I0FD3N5cgM/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Pragmatic Type Erasure: Solving OOP Problems Elegant Design Pattern"}}]}},"pageContext":{"speaker":"Zach Laine"}}
