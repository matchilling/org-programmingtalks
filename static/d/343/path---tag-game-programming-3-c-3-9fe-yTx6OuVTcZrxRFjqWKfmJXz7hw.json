It clearly separates pure and impure parts of the program.\nGame programming on the other hand is a very hands-on discipline, trying to wring out the most of the machine's performance, and aiming for one thing, in disregard of all else: a pleasant, challenging experience for the player.\nI aim to bring intersect those worlds and describe the process, and the specifics, of writing a Haskell game. Functional reactive programming, bindings to graphical libraries, etc, will all have a role to play.\n\nby Elise Huard (@elise_huard)\n\nElise Huard is a software consultant who's been crafting and bashing together software for about 15 years now.
