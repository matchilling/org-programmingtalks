And it's all built on top of an in-memory, transactional graph database.\n\nOne of the biggest game developers in the world needed a new IDE to build games for their engine. Eclipse just wasn't cutting it any more.\n\nIt may sound a bit nuts to use Clojure for desktop GUIs, but this architecture delivers incredible benefits to the tool developers.\n\nAbout the speakers: You can find Michael Nygard coding, writing, speaking, or thinking about how the Universe works. He has lived with systems in production and learned hard lessons about the importance of operations. Highly-available, highly-scalable commerce systems are his forte.\n\nRagnar Svensson has worked as a game developer for many years, starting out with player mechanics for AAA console games and transitioning into game engine programming, primarily for the mobile and web platforms. He co-founded the game engine Defold, which was acquired by King in 2014. He currently works for King as lead engine developer of the Defold engine.","meta":{"duration":"PT35M10S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"ajX09xQ_UEg","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"game-development-development-michael-nygard-and-ragnar-svensson","tag":["clojure","Video Game Development (Conference Subject)"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ajX09xQ_UEg/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Game Development Development - Michael Nygard & Ragnar Svensson"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"video-game-development-conference-subject","tag":"Video Game Development (Conference Subject)"}}
