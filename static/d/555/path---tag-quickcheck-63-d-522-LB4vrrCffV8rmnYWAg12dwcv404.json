I aim to use a Logic Programming tool (Kanrem or Prolog) to create the model and validate the results.\nTalk objectives:\n\nTo show how to use the powerful tools of logic programming and to how to build models to test Erlang code.\nTarget audience:\n\nThis will appeal to those who really enjoy programming languages and new tools.","meta":{"duration":"PT34M45S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"fSCIfsUcY4Y","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"zachary-kessin-using-logic-programming-tools-to-drive-property-based-testing","tag":["Erlang","Erlang User Conference","Zachary Kessin","QuickCheck","Proper"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fSCIfsUcY4Y/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Zachary Kessin - Using Logic Programming Tools to Drive Property-based Testing"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"quickcheck","tag":"QuickCheck"}}
