This talk will give a brief demonstration of many of the newest charting libs: mpld3 (using Seaborn/ggplot), nvd3-python, ggplot, Vincent, Bearcart, Folium,and Kartograph will be used to visualize a newly-released USGS/FAA wind energy dataset (with an assist from Pandas and the IPython Notebook). After a demo of the current state of Python and web viz, it will discuss the future of how the Python data stack can have seamless interoperability and interactivity with JavaScript visualization libraries.","meta":{"duration":"PT39M18S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"kmy-sfm3cC8","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"rob-story-up-and-down-the-python-data-and-web-visualization-stack","tag":["Python","Data Analysis","PyData","Visualization"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kmy-sfm3cC8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Rob Story - Up and Down the Python Data and Web Visualization Stack"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"visualization","tag":"Visualization"}}
