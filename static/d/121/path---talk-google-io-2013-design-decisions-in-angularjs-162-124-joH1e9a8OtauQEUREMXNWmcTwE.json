Come join us and learn how to build extremely scalable applications that are fast to build, trivial to change and maintain, easy to test, and that clearly express your intent to all developers on your team.\n\nFor all I/O 2013 sessions, go to https://developers.google.com/live","meta":{"duration":"PT40M"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"google-io-2013-design-decisions-in-angularjs","source":{"id":"HCR7i5F5L8c","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["chrome","gdl","i-o"],"title":"Google I/O 2013 - Design Decisions in AngularJS"},"allTalkJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"description":"Sameer Ajmani \n\nConcurrency is the key to designing high performance network services.
