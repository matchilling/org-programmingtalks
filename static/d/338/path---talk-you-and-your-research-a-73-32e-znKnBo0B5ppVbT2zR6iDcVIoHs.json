{"data":{"talkJson":{"description":"You and Your Research is the blueprint for a successful career in any discipline, not just research; in fact, the talk has the nickname “You and Your Career”. In this lecture, Richard Hamming shares his observations on “why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?’’ Some of the key ideas include courage, luck, drive (“knowledge and productivity are like compound interest”), a focus on important problems (“If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work”), open doors, selling the work (“I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others”), and much more. This should be required viewing for every high school student.","meta":{"duration":"PT44M3S"},"presenter":{"name":"Richard Hamming"},"slug":"you-and-your-research","source":{"id":"a1zDuOPkMSw","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["Inspiring","Career","Educational"],"title":"You and Your Research"},"allTalkJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"description":"Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg looks at why a smaller percentage of women than men reach the top of their professions -- and offers 3 powerful pieces of advice to women aiming for the C-suite.","meta":{"duration":"PT15M29S"},"presenter":{"name":"Sheryl Sandberg"},"source":{"id":"18uDutylDa4","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"why-we-have-too-few-women-leaders","tag":["TEDTalks","Career","Feminism"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/18uDutylDa4/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Why we have too few women leaders"}},{"node":{"description":"This persuasive talk shows how essential and easy it is to gain a basic understanding of computer science learning principles.

We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design. It also leads to code with potentially unwanted emergent properties. Today, we know how to create programs that can create programming languages. So why not write software that closely follows the problem, without a programming language, then let other programs create the programming language to support it? If we apply this rethinking to the design process, both problems and solutions can be thought of in terms of relational str","meta":{"duration":"PT1H7M19S"},"presenter":{"name":"Alan Kay"},"source":{"id":"QboI_1WJUlM","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"rethinking-design-risk-and-software","tag":["Inspiring","Keynote","COFES 2012"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QboI_1WJUlM/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Rethinking Design, Risk, and Software"}},{"node":{"description":"Drawing from some of the most pivotal points in his life, Steve Jobs, chief executive officer and co-founder of Apple Computer and of Pixar Animation Studios, urged graduates to pursue their dreams and see the opportunities in life's setbacks.","meta":{"duration":"PT15M5S"},"presenter":{"name":"Steve Jobs"},"source":{"id":"UF8uR6Z6KLc","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-address","tag":["Stanford University","Educational","Keynote","Inspiring","Commencement Speech"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UF8uR6Z6KLc/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address"}},{"node":{"description":"Why do people succeed?
