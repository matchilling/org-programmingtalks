Cassowary is a fast constraint solver which now powers auto layout in iOS applications. The JavaScript port of Cassowary brings fast constraint programming to the browser.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to constraint programming, a walkthrough of the JavaScript Cassowary library, and an implementation of several \"how the heck did you do that\" programs with constraints.","meta":{"duration":"PT28M15S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"72sWgwaAoyk","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"jsconfus-2013-adam-solove-constraint-programming-in-the-browser","tag":["constraint programming"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72sWgwaAoyk/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"[JSConfUS 2013] Adam Solove: Constraint programming in the browser"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"constraint-programming","tag":"constraint programming"}}
