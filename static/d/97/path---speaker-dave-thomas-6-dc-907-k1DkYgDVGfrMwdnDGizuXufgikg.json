{"data":{"allTalkJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"description":"Dave Thomas was one of the creators of the Agile Manifesto. A year ago, he told us that Agile is Dead. How could this be? Why had he deserted us? And what are we to do? It turns out that while the \"Agile\" industry is busy debasing the meaning of the word, the underlying values are still strong. In this talk, Dave will draw a distinction, and show us how to reclaim agility for ourselves. As usual, he'll probably end up making some friends, and making some enemies. Which will you be?","meta":{"duration":"PT40M39S"},"presenter":{"name":"Dave Thomas"},"source":{"id":"a-BOSpxYJ9M","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"agile-is-dead-pragmatic","tag":["Keynote","Agile","GOTO 2015"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a-BOSpxYJ9M/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Agile is Dead"}},{"node":{"description":"I'm a language nut. I love trying them out, and I love thinking about their design and implementation. (I know, it's sad.) I came across Ruby in 1998 because I was an avid reader of comp.lang.misc (ask your parents). I downloaded it, compiled it, and fell in love. As with any time you fall in love, it's difficult to explain why. It just worked the way I work, and it had enough depth to keep me interested. Fast forward 15 years. All that time I'd been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling. Then I came across Elixir, a language by Jos√© Valim, that puts a humane, Ruby-like syntax on the Erlang VM. Now I'm dangerous. I want other people to see just how great this is. I want to evangelize. So come along and let me show you the things that I think make Elixir a serious alternative for writing highly reliable, scalable, and performant server code. And, more important, let me show you some fun stuff.","meta":{"duration":"PT49M42S"},"presenter":{"name":"Dave Thomas"},"source":{"id":"lww1aZ-ldz0","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"elixir-the-power-of-erlang-the-joy-of-ruby","tag":["Erlang","Ruby","GOTO 2014"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lww1aZ-ldz0/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Elixir: The Power of Erlang, the Joy of Ruby"}}]}},"pageContext":{"speaker":"Dave Thomas"}}
