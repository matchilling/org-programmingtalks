This session will present to the listeners a range of concrete methods and techniques applicable in different phases of a design process, to handle specific challenges. This will include design patterns, personas, wire framing, paper prototype testing, progressive disclosure, card sorting and creative workshops and many of the methods and techniques will be accompanied by examples.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","meta":{"duration":"PT51M20S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"7OSkB4BCx00","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"user-interface-ux-techniques-janne-jul-jensen","tag":["Software Development","Janne Jul Jensen","User Interface Design (Field Of Study)","User Interface (Ontology Instance)","User Interface","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","User Experience Design (Industry)","Technology (Industry)","User Interface (Speech Topic)","UX","Trifork","Design (Industry)","Programming Language","Videos for Developers"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7OSkB4BCx00/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"User Interface (UX) Techniques â€¢ Janne Jul Jensen"}},{"node":{"description":"It is the first TEDx talk of the founder of Free Software movement.

Producing a few PSDs doesn't cut it anymore, we have to start seeing the things we design as components within larger systems. Join us to learn how to use Polymer to revolutionize your design process. With these new tools we can create the UIs of the future, and shorten the time between concept and reality.\n\nWatch all Google I/O 2014 videos at: g.co/io14videos","meta":{"duration":"PT41M31S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"HKrYfrAzqFA","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"google-io-2014-unlock-the-next-era-of-ui-development-with-polymer","tag":["Google","I/O","IO","io14","Develop","Polymer","product: web","fullname: Rob Dodson","Location: other","Team: Scalable Advocacy","Type: Live Event","GDS: Upload only","Other: NoGreenScreen"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HKrYfrAzqFA/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Google I/O 2014 - Unlock the next era of UI development with Polymer"}},{"node":{"description":"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Simon Peyton Jones wants children not just to consume technology, but to be creative with it. What does that mean for teaching computer science in schools, and why is the rest of the world watching England?\n\nSimon Peyton Jones is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. His research focus is in programming language design and implementation, and the purely-functional language Haskell in particular. He is a founder member and current chair of the Computing at School working group, which has played a central role in the recent reform of the school Computing curriculum.\n\nAt TEDxExeter 2014 our speakers and performers connected us with other worlds. Our talks exposed corruption in big business, shared effective approaches to tackling social inequality and gave a voice to those whose human rights are under threat. We explored the impact of fast changing technologies on all our lives. We journeyed through fire and forest to frozen landscapes. We were challenged to consider worlds of extremes, cutting edge controversies and risky opportunities.\nhttps://twitter.com/simonpj0\n\nVideo Production Chromatrope (http://chromatrope.co.uk/)\nProduction Manager Andy Robertson (http://www.youtube.com/familygamertv)\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)","meta":{"duration":"PT14M50S"},"presenter":{"name":"Simon Peyton Jones"},"source":{"id":"Ia55clAtdMs","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"teaching-creative-computer-science","tag":["TEDTalks","Politics"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia55clAtdMs/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Teaching creative computer science"}},{"node":{"description":"Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong.
