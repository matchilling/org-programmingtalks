JavaScript?! Why on earth would you make robots with JavaScript?\"\n\nIt's a fair question, and one worthy of more than a hand-wavy answer about how it's cool... or something.\n\nIn this talk, let's discuss why, of all the languages on the planet, JavaScript is the perfect starting point for a future of robotics.\n\nAs a roboticist-turned-web-developer, I will provide some deep insights not only into the world of robotics, but also into JavaScript and its server-side cousin, Node.js. We'll talk about what JavaScript-enabled robots can already do, what they can't do yet, and what they might be able to do with a bit of elbow grease.\n\nAnd, if the demo deities are with us, we may even have a robot assistant on hand.\n\nRaquel Vélez\nNPM, INC.\n@rockbot\n\nRaquel Vélez is a Senior Software Developer at npm, Inc. in Oakland, CA.
