It was originally designed as an extension to C, and keeps a similar syntax, but is now a completely different language. Use this tag for questions about code (to be) compiled with a C++ compiler.","clojure":"Clojure ( /ˈkloʊʒɜːr/, like \\"closure\\") is a dialect of the Lisp programming language. Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java virtual machine and the Common Language Runtime. There is a dialect, developed in lockstep with Clojure, called ClojureScript, that compiles to ECMAScript 3. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system. The current development process is community-driven, overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL). Clojure encourages immutability and immutable data structures. While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of gradual typing. Clojure encourages programmers to be explicit about managing state and identity. This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs is intended to facilitate developing more robust programs, especially multithreaded ones.","continuous-delivery":"Continuous delivery (CD or CDE) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, doing so manually. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.","erlang":"Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang\'s runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.","extreme-programming":"Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent \\"releases\\" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.\\n\\nOther elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer\'s requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to \\"extreme\\" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.","google":"Google is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.","googletechtalks":"Google Tech Talks is a grass-roots program at Google for sharing information of interest to the technical community.  At its best, it\'s part of an ongoing discussion about our world featuring top experts in diverse fields.  Presentations range from the broadest of perspective overviews to the most technical of deep dives, on topics well-established to wildly speculative.","goto-conference":"Created for developers, by developers, GOTO Conferences are focused on bringing the best minds in the software community and the most interesting topics to light. This channel features video interviews and presentations from GOTO Conferences and GOTO Nights.\\n\\nGOTO Conferences are produced by Trifork, a leading full service supplier of high-quality custom-built applications and end-to-end solutions.","haskell":"Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose, purely functional programming language with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It is named after logician Haskell Curry.","nodejs":"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage\'s HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user\'s web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user\'s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \\"JavaScript everywhere\\" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.","progressive-web-app":"Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are: Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions. Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling. Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience. This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user\'s home screen.","ruby":"Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \\"Matz\\" Matsumoto in Japan. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.","rust":"Rust is a systems programming language sponsored by Mozilla Research, which describes it as a \\"safe, concurrent, practical language\\", supporting functional and imperative-procedural paradigms. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but its designers intend it to provide better memory safety whilst maintaining performance.\\n\\nRust is an open source programming language. Its designers have refined the language through the experiences of writing the Servo web browser layout engine and the Rust compiler. A large portion of current commits to the project are from community members.\\n\\nRust won first place for \\"most loved programming language\\" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The language is referenced in The Book of Mozilla as \\"oxidised metal\\".","software-architecture":"Software architecture refers to the high level structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.","tedtalks":"TED Talks shares the best ideas from the TED Conference with the world, for free: trusted voices and convention-breaking mavericks, icons and geniuses, all giving the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.
