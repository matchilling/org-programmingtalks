This is so familiar that it's easy to take for granted. How do we go from a sequence of characters to something the machine can execute? Knowing this will not only help you program more effectively, but it will empower you to create your own programming languages. I'll give an overview of the pipeline from your text editor to the machine's behavior. Then, we'll dive in and look at specific tools that will help us create our own programming language. We'll also discuss different language design decisions, such as static versus dynamic typing, and see how they are implemented behind the scenes. By the end, you'll be ready to bring your new language into the world!",meta:{duration:"PT26M8S"},presenter:{name:null},slug:"lambdaconf-2015-make-your-own-programming-language-nick-heiner",source:{id:"DE18fHyZ0GI",provider:"youtube"},tag:[],title:"LambdaConf 2015 - Make Your Own Programming Language!
