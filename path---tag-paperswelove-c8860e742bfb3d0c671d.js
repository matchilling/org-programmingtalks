Published as a paper many years later, Strachey's lectures provide an especially readable overview of programming languages concepts.\n\nBio\n----\nJohn Myles White (@johnmyleswhite) is a Julia hacker who loves thinking about the ways in which the design of technical programming languages influences the way in which we think about statistics and machine learning.
