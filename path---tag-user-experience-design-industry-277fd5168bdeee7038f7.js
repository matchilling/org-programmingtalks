Learn the power of the Observable and how Netflix has simplified code through the ability to filter, aggregate, compose and project data streams.\n\nThis talk discusses how Netflix uses Rx to:\n- Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag and drop)\n- Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests\n- Reactively update the UI in response to data changes\n- Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events\n- Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exceptions\n\nSlides: http://www.slideboom.com/presentations/1002549/Async-Javascript-at-Netflix-2014-03-19?pk=58d9-8985-be37-25f7-dc90-fe60-a9e2-03ab\n",meta:{duration:"PT28M39S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"FAZJsxcykPs",provider:"youtube"},slug:"netflix-javascript-talks-async-javascript-with-reactive-extensions",tag:["JavaScript","netflix","netflix ui engineering","Functional Programming (Programming Language Paradigm)","User Experience Design (Industry)","Web Development (Interest)","Reactive Programming"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FAZJsxcykPs/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Netflix JavaScript Talks - Async JavaScript with Reactive Extensions"}},{node:{description:"Check out our upcoming conferences at http://gotocon.com\nSubscribe to the GOTO Conferences YouTube Channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/GOTOConf...\n\nJanne Jul Jensen - Interaction Designer and Usability Specialist\n\nABSTRACT\nMost developers today are aware of the importance of creating a good user interface with a high level of usability, but many are lacking the methods and techniques that can help in this process. This session will present to the listeners a range of concrete methods and techniques applicable in different phases of a design process, to handle specific challenges. This will include design patterns, personas, wire framing, paper prototype testing, progressive disclosure, card sorting and creative workshops and many of the methods and techniques will be accompanied by examples.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com",meta:{duration:"PT51M20S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"7OSkB4BCx00",provider:"youtube"},slug:"user-interface-ux-techniques-janne-jul-jensen",tag:["Software Development","Janne Jul Jensen","User Interface Design (Field Of Study)","User Interface (Ontology Instance)","User Interface","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","User Experience Design (Industry)","Technology (Industry)","User Interface (Speech Topic)","UX","Trifork","Design (Industry)","Programming Language","Videos for Developers"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7OSkB4BCx00/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"User Interface (UX) Techniques â€¢ Janne Jul Jensen"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"user-experience-design-industry",tag:"User Experience Design (Industry)"}}}});
