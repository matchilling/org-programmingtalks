Regrettably, we spend very little time reading completely foreign code and instead we collect techniques one by one over years.\r\n\r\nIt needn't be that way: this presentation is a cookbook with examples of all the C programming tricks I have found value in.  Not just the basics like valgrind, talloc and the Jenkins hash, but less sane techniques like typesafe callbacks, runtime code updating, C as a scripting language and malloc failure path testing.\r\n\r\nEveryone who codes in C will get something out of this talk.\n\nhttp://2011.linux.conf.au/ - http://www.linux.org.au\nCC BY-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt",meta:{duration:"PT46M53S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BEQ3sRakIs0",provider:"youtube"},slug:"advanced-c-coding-for-fun",tag:["LCA2011","Linux","Open Source"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Advanced C Coding For Fun!"}},{node:{description:'Richard Stallman in Zurich: The father of the movement for free software about his rebellion against administrative slack at MIT, about "foolish" Apple aficionados, current fights against evil software companies and Swiss national hero William Tell, who could serve as a role model in the fight against an unjust copyright.\n\nBy the way: After the camera was turned off, Richard and I talked about some other topics: Ads in the web and his Free Software song.
