Imagine booting to the BEAM VM in just a few seconds with your Elixir app in control of the entire system. Nerves makes this possible while replacing the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files with a toolchain that is delightful to use. The Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at start-up time: Elixir. Together, we'll explore the principles Nerves uses to create embedded systems that control 3d printers, power unmanned areal vehicles, and more. You'll see first-hand how Nerves can support service discovery, hot code swapping, and collaboration through PubSub messages and mesh networking. Finally, we will explore the Nerves development life-cycle; from running ExTest, to deployment and hot code reloading.\\n\\nTalk objectives\\n\\n* Introduce developing embedded systems in Elixir using Nerves\\n\\n* Explore the Nerves development life-cycle\\n\\n* Demonstrate autonomous robotics using service discovery and messaging\\n\\n* Execute tests, create user interfaces with Phoenix, and perform hot code updates\\n\\nTarget audience\\n\\nCreating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature.
