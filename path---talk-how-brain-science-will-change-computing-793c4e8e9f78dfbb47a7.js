The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: \"We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.\" And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'\"",meta:{duration:"PT32M56S"},presenter:{name:"Bret Victor"},source:{id:"8pTEmbeENF4",provider:"youtube"},slug:"the-future-of-programming",tag:["Inspiring","Funny","DBX conference 2013"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pTEmbeENF4/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"The Future of Programming"}},{node:{description:"It is the first TEDx talk of the founder of Free Software movement.

Simon Peyton Jones wants children not just to consume technology, but to be creative with it. What does that mean for teaching computer science in schools, and why is the rest of the world watching England?\n\nSimon Peyton Jones is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. His research focus is in programming language design and implementation, and the purely-functional language Haskell in particular. He is a founder member and current chair of the Computing at School working group, which has played a central role in the recent reform of the school Computing curriculum.\n\nAt TEDxExeter 2014 our speakers and performers connected us with other worlds. Our talks exposed corruption in big business, shared effective approaches to tackling social inequality and gave a voice to those whose human rights are under threat. We explored the impact of fast changing technologies on all our lives. We journeyed through fire and forest to frozen landscapes. We were challenged to consider worlds of extremes, cutting edge controversies and risky opportunities.\nhttps://twitter.com/simonpj0\n\nVideo Production Chromatrope (http://chromatrope.co.uk/)\nProduction Manager Andy Robertson (http://www.youtube.com/familygamertv)\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",meta:{duration:"PT14M50S"},presenter:{name:"Simon Peyton Jones"},source:{id:"Ia55clAtdMs",provider:"youtube"},slug:"teaching-creative-computer-science",tag:["TEDTalks","Politics"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ia55clAtdMs/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Teaching creative computer science"}},{node:{description:"One of my all time favorite talks of Alan Kay's, given in 2015.\n\nNot my own video, though it hasn't been on YouTube before.
