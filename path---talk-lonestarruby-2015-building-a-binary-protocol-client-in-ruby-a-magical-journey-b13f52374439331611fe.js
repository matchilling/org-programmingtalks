If you've ever wondered how to set about building a library for a binary protocol, how to reverse-engineer the byte-by-byte traffic on a network, or thought it would be cool to understand Ruby's networking capabilities from the ground up, this talk is for you!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HBVG/",meta:{duration:"PT30M27S"},presenter:{name:null},slug:"lonestarruby-2015-building-a-binary-protocol-client-in-ruby-a-magical-journey",source:{id:"JLoOAGEAAjo",provider:"youtube"},tag:[],title:"LoneStarRuby 2015 - Building a binary protocol client in Ruby: A magical journey!"},allTalkJson:null},pathContext:{slug:"lonestarruby-2015-building-a-binary-protocol-client-in-ruby-a-magical-journey",tags:[]}}}});
