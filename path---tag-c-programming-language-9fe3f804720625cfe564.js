C++11 extends type deduction to include universal references, applies it to auto variables and lambda expressions, then throws in a special auto-only deduction rule. C++14 pushes the boundary further, adding two forms of function return type deduction (auto and decltype(auto)) for arbitrary functions and offering auto parameters for lambdas. The result is that what could be treated as a black box in C++98 has become a topic that practicing C++ developers really need to understand. This talk will give you the information you need to do that.\n--\nScott Meyers has been working with C++ since 1988. He recently finished his new book, "Effective Modern C++".\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com',meta:{duration:"PT1H9M34S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"wQxj20X-tIU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"cppcon-2014-scott-meyers-type-deduction-and-why-you-care",tag:["C (Programming Language)","Bash Films"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wQxj20X-tIU/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:'CppCon 2014: Scott Meyers "Type Deduction and Why You Care"'}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"c-programming-language",tag:"C (Programming Language)"}}}});
