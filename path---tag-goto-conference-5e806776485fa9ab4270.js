Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured "Big Data" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com',meta:{duration:"PT1H4M52S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BeNrVl2_nyI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft",tag:["Software Engineering (Industry)","Innovation (Quotation Subject)","Database (Software Genre)","DevOps","big data","pathways","adrian cockcroft","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","Adrian Cockcroft","Speed & Scale"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft"}},{node:{description:"Anyone ever give you advice on how to remain a programmer?

Lisp marked the beginning of functional programming, interpreters, high-level metaprogramming, garbage collection, and much more. Yet after such auspicious beginnings the idea of Lisp has since faded and many of its innovations have been adopted by much more popular programming languages. Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\n\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript.

As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors.\nAfter thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted.\nThis talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour "Shifting the Burden" and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself. Dan believes you can learn to recognise these coping mechanisms for what they are, and intends to set you on the path to simplicating your programming life. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com',meta:{duration:"PT55M31S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"XqgwHXsQA1g",provider:"youtube"},slug:"kicking-the-complexity-habit-dan-north",tag:["Software As A Service (Industry)","Application Software (Software Genre)","Programming Language","dan north","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","Programmer (Profession)","complexity"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Kicking the Complexity Habit • Dan North"}},{node:{description:"This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2015\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nKyle Kingsbury - Author of Jepsen\n\nABSTRACT\nStateless applications aren't: they rely on other systems storing and transforming shared state correctly.
