This talk will give a brief demonstration of many of the newest charting libs: mpld3 (using Seaborn/ggplot), nvd3-python, ggplot, Vincent, Bearcart, Folium,and Kartograph will be used to visualize a newly-released USGS/FAA wind energy dataset (with an assist from Pandas and the IPython Notebook). After a demo of the current state of Python and web viz, it will discuss the future of how the Python data stack can have seamless interoperability and interactivity with JavaScript visualization libraries.",meta:{duration:"PT39M18S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"kmy-sfm3cC8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"rob-story-up-and-down-the-python-data-and-web-visualization-stack",tag:["Python","Data Analysis","PyData","Visualization"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kmy-sfm3cC8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Rob Story - Up and Down the Python Data and Web Visualization Stack"}},{node:{description:"PyData SV 2014 \nMany real-world datasets have missing observations, noise and outliers; usually due to logistical problems, component failures and erroneous procedures during the data collection process. Although it is easy to avoid missing points and noise to some level, it is not easy to detect wrong measurements and outliers in the dataset. These outliers may present a larger problem in time-series signals since every data point has a temporal dependency to the data point before and after. Therefore, it is crucially important to be able to detect and possibly correct these outliers. In this talk, I will introduce three different methods to be able to detect outliers in time-series signals; Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Median Filtering and Bayesian approach. http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-03-31/outlier-detection-in-time-series-signals-fft-median-filtering/",meta:{duration:"PT36M30S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"t4zEeujVht8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"bugra-akyildiz-outlier-detection-in-time-series-signals",tag:["Python","Data Analysis","PyData","Time Series","Bayesian Approach"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t4zEeujVht8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Bugra Akyildiz - Outlier Detection in Time Series Signals"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"data-analysis",tag:"Data Analysis"}}}});
