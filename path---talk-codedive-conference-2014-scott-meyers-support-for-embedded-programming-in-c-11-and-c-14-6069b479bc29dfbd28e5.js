In the early 1990s, the C++ standardisation committee adopted the Vasa as a cautionary tale, discouraging prospective language extensions with "Remember the Vasa!" Yet C++ continued to grow, and by the time C++ was standardised, its complexity made the Vasa look like a rowboat.\n\nThe Vasa sank, however, while C++ cruised, and it looks likely to continue doing so even as the latest revised standards (C++11 and C++14) add dozens of new features, each with its own idiosyncrasies. Clearly, C++ has gotten some important things right. In this talk, Scott Meyers considers the lessons to be learned from the ongoing success of a complex programming language that\'s over 30 years old, yet very much alive and kicking.',meta:{duration:"PT1H7M3S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"ltCgzYcpFUI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"why-c-sails-when-the-vasa-sank",tag:["c++","C++11","C++14","scott meyers","C++ and beyond","cppcon","herb sutter","gcc","microsoft","Bjarne Stroustrup (Author)","effective C++","Vasa (Ship)"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ltCgzYcpFUI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Why C++ Sails When the Vasa Sank"}},{node:{description:" ",meta:{duration:"PT46M47S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"sajBj_eiH10",provider:"youtube"},slug:"using-c11-to-speed-up-your-qt-5-programs-marc-mutz",tag:["Using","C++11","to","speed","up","your","Qt","5","programs","Marc","Mutz"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sajBj_eiH10/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Using C++11 to speed up your Qt 5 programs   Marc Mutz"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"codedive-conference-2014-scott-meyers-support-for-embedded-programming-in-c11-and-c14",tags:["Nokia Wrocław","Scott Meyers:","code::dive","code::dive conference 2014","C++11","C++14"]}}}});
