As Object Oriented methodologies gained popularity, MVC too gained traction as a natural and logical way to construct user interfaces despite obvious shortcomings. Even though OO researchers moved forward with alternative approaches likes Morphic and constraint based systems, MVC today maintains a stranglehold on mainstream developer approaches to UI.\n\nCan functional programming take the good lessons from MVC while advancing the state of the art? Functional Reactive Programming and its derivatives primarily solve complexities around events - what of component modularity and abstraction?\n\nWe'll examine how a new library for ClojureScript called Om, a simple functional layer over Facebook's React, makes some traditional hard problems in MVC based UIs simple without abandoning the abstractions OO programmers find so useful.

These generalize the notions you already know how to use into a form that is easier to compose and simultaneously allow them to be used for monomorphic containers such as Data.Text. \n\nAll without compromising on your ability to reason about them using laws!\n\nFinally, once I've built up some foundations, I do a bit of a deep dive, exploring consequences of this design. In particular we discuss the efficient generic programming programming framework exported by lens, and type-safe Traversal-based zippers.\n\nFamiliarity with the Applicative and Traversable classes from the Haskell base libraries will be helpful (links provided below), but a basic understanding of the concepts get introduced as I go along. \n\nUseful (but not mandatory) references:\n\nThe lens library and documentation: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens\nA previous, more introductory talk on how to use the lenses Edward Kmett wrote for the scalaz in the Scala programming language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efv0SQNde5Q\nThe original Applicative paper: http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf\nLots of information on Traversable: http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/iterator.pdf\nA write-up of this talk, as presented at the Bay Area Haskell Users Group: http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2012/10/lenses-folds-and-traversals-haskell.html\n\nThe original Keynote version of the slides are available from http://comonad.com/haskell/Lenses-Folds-and-Traversals-NYC.key\n\nThanks go to Johan Kiviniemi, who worked magic when it came to cleaning up the audio for this recording!",meta:{duration:"PT1H54M46S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"cefnmjtAolY",provider:"youtube"},slug:"lenses-folds-and-traversals",tag:["Haskell","Functional Programming","Haskell","Mathematics","Lecture","Talk","Academic","Talking","Computer"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cefnmjtAolY/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Lenses, Folds, and Traversals"}},{node:{description:"Racket is the best programming language that embraces the premise that there is no best programming language. In other words, Racket is designed to support the creation of programming languages which can then be used to build programs. Using Racket, we have built program languages ranging from large, general-purpose languages matching particular programming paradigms to small, specialized programming languages designed for just a single file in some larger program.\n\nIn this talk, I will bring across how it feels to program in such a language, discuss some of the technical support Racket has to make such programming practical, and show how Racketâ€™s standard libraries have embraced this perspective, enabling us to include lots of batteries.\n\nRobby is an associate professor of computer science at Northwestern University and received his PhD from Rice University in 2002. He is the author or two textbooks, one on introductory programming and one on operational semantics. Robby is one of the core developers of Racket and has helped shape the design the language since its inception in 1994.\n\nFor more on Lambda Jam, visit http://www.lambdajam.com",meta:{duration:"PT51M43S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"hFlIl0Zo234",provider:"youtube"},slug:"lambda-jam-2015-robby-findler-racket-a-programming-language-programming-language",tag:["Robby Findler","Lambda Jam 2015","Racket","Programming Languages","Functional Programming"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hFlIl0Zo234/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Lambda Jam 2015 - Robby Findler - Racket: A Programming-Language Programming Language"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"functional-programming-what-why-when",tags:["Functional Programming","NDC Conference 2014"]}}}});
