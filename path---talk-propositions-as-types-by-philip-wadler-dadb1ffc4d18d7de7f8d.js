At first sight it appears to be a simple coincidence---almost a pun---but it turns out to be remarkably robust, inspiring the design of theorem provers and programming languages, and continuing to influence the forefronts of computing. Propositions as Types has many names and many origins, and is a notion with depth, breadth, and mystery. Learn why functional programming is (and is not) the universal programming language.\n\nPhilip Wadler\nUNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH\n@PhilipWadler\n\nPhilip Wadler is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.
