Andy completed his Ph.D. at Indiana University, defending his dissertation, \\\"A Nanopass Framework for Commercial Compiler Development\\\", in December 2012 and will be presenting a paper related to this work at this year's International Conference on Functional Programming. This project focused on replacing Chez Scheme's compiler with a nanopass compiler, along with his adviser R. Kent Dybvig. Before returning to graduate school in 2007, Andy worked in industry as a web developer, first for the consulting firms Razorfish and Gotham Broadband, along with some independent consulting work for Viacom, and later worked full time at Teach For America, maintaining both front-end and back-end web applications.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT40M48S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"Os7FE3J-U5Q\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"andy-keep-writing-a-nanopass-compiler\",\"tag\":[\"clojure\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Os7FE3J-U5Q/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Andy Keep - Writing a Nanopass Compiler\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"This presentation will introduce a new start-up focused on machine learning that is using Clojure.

As such, neither the traditional tools of analytics (R, Mathematica, Matlab) nor mainstreams languages (Java, C++, C#) supply its requirements well as they cannot simultaneously provide the mathematical abstractions and real-word platform power that are required. Clojure is privileged in that it has the potential to provide just exactly that.

This approach connects you in a profoundly direct way to the work, your effort to the result. This changed with the rise of machine tools, which made production more efficient but also altered what's made and how we think about making it in in a profound way. This talk explores the effects of automation on our work, which is as relevant to software as it is to furniture, especially now that once again, with Clojure, we are building things using a small set of simple tools.\\n\\nTim Ewald designs and builds software systems.
