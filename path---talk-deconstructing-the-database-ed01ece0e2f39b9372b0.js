Ideas once lost to the mainstream are found again.\n\nIn this keynote we revisit the present through the past, looking at the enduring principles that shape programming languages, architecture, development practice and development process, the ideas that cycle round, each time becoming perhaps a little better defined, a little more mature, and look to see what else might be on the horizon.",meta:{duration:"PT50M23S"},presenter:{name:"Kevlin Henney"},source:{id:"AbgsfeGvg3E",provider:"youtube"},slug:"old-is-the-new-new",tag:["GOTO Conference","Keynote","Architecture","Languages"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AbgsfeGvg3E/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Old Is the New New"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"deconstructing-the-database",tags:["Database","JaxConf 2012","Architecture"]}}}});
