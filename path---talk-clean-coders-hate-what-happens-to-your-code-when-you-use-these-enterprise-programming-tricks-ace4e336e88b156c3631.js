Poor code, however, is rarely arbitrary and random in its structure or formulation. Systems of code, well or poorly structured, emerge from systems of practice, whether effective or ineffective. To improve code quality, it makes more sense to pick apart the specific practices and see their interplay — the cause — than to simply focus on the code itself — the effect. This talk looks at how a handful of coding habits, design practices and assumptions can systematically balloon code and compound its accidental complexity.",meta:{duration:"PT1H11M23S"},presenter:{name:"Kevlin Henney"},slug:"clean-coders-hate-what-happens-to-your-code-when-you-use-these-enterprise-programming-tricks",source:{id:"FyCYva9DhsI",provider:"youtube"},tag:["NDC Conferences","Clean Code"],title:"Clean Coders Hate What Happens to Your Code When You Use These Enterprise Programming Tricks"},allTalkJson:{edges:[{node:{description:"This talk speculates about the next language after JavaScript, and what to do in the mean time about some of the new features in ES6.\nThere will be an emphasis on simplicity and quality.

What big problems did programmers encounter in the past? How were they solved? And how do those solutions impact our future? What mistakes have we made as a profession; and how are we going to correct them. In this talk, Uncle Bob describes the history of software, from it’s beginnings in 1948 up through the current day; and then beyond. By looking at our past trajectory, we try to plot out where our profession is headed, and what challenges we’ll face along the way.\n\nRobert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) has been a programmer since 1970.
