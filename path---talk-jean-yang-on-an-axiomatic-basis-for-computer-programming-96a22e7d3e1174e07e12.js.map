Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \\\"Big Data\\\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour \\\"Shifting the Burden\\\" and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \\\"Big Data\\\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\\n\\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\\nhttp://gotocon.com\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H4M52S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"BeNrVl2_nyI\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft\",\"tag\":[\"Software Engineering (Industry)\",\"Innovation (Quotation Subject)\",\"Database (Software Genre)\",\"DevOps\",\"big data\",\"pathways\",\"adrian cockcroft\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"Adrian Cockcroft\",\"Speed & Scale\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Check out our upcoming conferences at http://gotocon.com\\nSubscribe to GOTO Conference's YouTube Channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/GOTOConferences?sub_confirmation=1\\n\\nDouglas Crockford - JSON Creator & Yahoo!

Come learn how to build AngularJS apps that manage multiple screens, structure your application code, maintain clean code with popular patterns, implement CRUD, perform robust HTML validation, use local storage, pass unit tests, and use a automated build tasks.

It wraps common patterns behind a friendly API for reading, writing, and processing data. We'll start with some fundamentals of the library and how it can enable you to work very close to raw data with ease. \\n\\nAfter an introduction to Okio, we will look at three libraries written with it: OkHttp, a modern HTTP client; Retrofit, a high-level HTTP wrapper; and Moshi, a brand new library for serialization. \\n\\nNot only are these libraries powerful on their own, but when combined their efficiency and performance dramatically increase. We'll conclude with demonstration of how to use them in your applications to great effect. \\n\\n- Jake Wharton\\n\\nAndroid developer for Square working on Square Cash.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour \\\"Shifting the Burden\\\" and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself. Dan believes you can learn to recognise these coping mechanisms for what they are, and intends to set you on the path to simplicating your programming life. \\n\\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\\nhttp://gotocon.com\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT55M31S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"XqgwHXsQA1g\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"kicking-the-complexity-habit-dan-north\",\"tag\":[\"Software As A Service (Industry)\",\"Application Software (Software Genre)\",\"Programming Language\",\"dan north\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"Programmer (Profession)\",\"complexity\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Kicking the Complexity Habit • Dan North\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Check out our upcoming conferences at http://gotocon.com\\nSubscribe to the GOTO Conferences YouTube Channel at https://www.youtube.com/user/GOTOConf...\\n\\nJanne Jul Jensen - Interaction Designer and Usability Specialist\\n\\nABSTRACT\\nMost developers today are aware of the importance of creating a good user interface with a high level of usability, but many are lacking the methods and techniques that can help in this process.
