Lately, we are seeing an explosion in JVM languages. This is partly, but not only, because of Java 7, the first JVM to ship with invokedynamic, which is a quantum leap in polyglot runtime implementation. This session explains why emerging language implementations are becoming more common and more feasible to implement on the JVM with satisfactory performance. It tells you how we got there and walks through the technology already in place (such as invokedynamic) and that which is in progress. The future for the JVM is bright indeed.

You understand how to rig up the CLASSPATH, get .class files to load, compile source, and set up an IDE. But you\'ve always wanted a better understanding of the plumbing underneath. How does JVM bytecode work? How does the JVM itself work? This presentation walks you through JVM and JVM bytecode basics, with lots of examples of how to bend the JVM to your whims.\n\nCopyright © 2013 Oracle and/or its affiliates.
