Traditional software concurrency management leads to non-deterministic race conditions and deadlocks that are hard to reproduce and debug, leading to unreliable software. That means it's time to introduce math. Tony Hoare's paradigm of communicating sequential processes, or CSP, is not only a robust way to manage concurrency, but it's fun too! Join us to learn more about how CSP in the Go programming language allows us to reason more clearly about many things happening at once.\n\nAbout Eric:\n\nEric Shull is a software consultant and developer at Atomic Object.
