Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon.\n\nBut how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples.\n\nI use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture. Developing a "modern style," however, is essential if we don\'t want to maintain newly-written 1970s and 1980s style code in 2020.\n\nThis presentation reflects my thoughts on what "Modern C++" should mean in the 2010s: a language for programming based on light-weight abstraction with direct and efficient mapping to hardware, suitable for infrastructure code.',meta:{duration:"PT1H29M48S"},presenter:{name:"Bjarne Stroustrup"},source:{id:"0iWb_qi2-uI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"keynote-goingnative-2012",tag:["C++","GoingNative","Keynote"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iWb_qi2-uI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Keynote GoingNative 2012 C++"}},{node:{description:"Hartmut Kaisers Keynote from Meeting C++ 2014\n\nSlides:\nhttp://meetingcpp.com/index.php/tv14/items/26.html",meta:{duration:"PT1H27M36S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"4OCUEgSNIAY",provider:"youtube"},slug:"plain-threads-are-the-goto-of-todays-computing-hartmut-kaiser-keynote-meeting-c-2014",tag:["Software (Industry)","C (Programming Language)","C++","Meeting C++","Keynote","Parallelism","Concurrency","Threading","Thread","HPX","Meeting C++ 2014"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4OCUEgSNIAY/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Plain Threads are the GOTO of todays computing - Hartmut Kaiser - Keynote Meeting C++ 2014"}},{node:{description:"Systems get bigger, technologies reach further, practices mature, advice changes... or at least some of it does. Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.",meta:{duration:"PT1H7M3S"},presenter:{name:"Kevlin Henney"},source:{id:"B3b4tremI5o",provider:"youtube"},slug:"small-is-beautiful",tag:["GOTO Conference","Keynote","GOTO Copenhagen","Scaling","Legacy System","Simplicity"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Small Is Beautiful"}},{node:{description:'Aaron Swartz keynote - "How we stopped SOPA"  at F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012, Washington DC on May 21 2012.\n\nhttp://freedom-to-connect.net/',meta:{duration:"PT22M52S"},presenter:{name:"Aaron Swartz"},source:{id:"Fgh2dFngFsg",provider:"youtube"},slug:"f2c2012-aaron-swartz-keynote-how-we-stopped-sopa",tag:["SOPA","freedom to connect","internet freedom","Keynote"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fgh2dFngFsg/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:'"How we stopped SOPA"'}},{node:{description:"This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2015\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nErik Meijer - Founder at Applied Duality, Inc.\n\nABSTRACT\nErik challenges the basic ideas on Scrum & Agile and how developers should be developing code for the future.

We’ve done this in an incremental fashion, building code on top of code. We write understandable snippets of code built on programming languages we know well and then bundle them into program structures to perform complex tasks. This incremental process may seem to have low risk at the snippet level, but it leads to program structures that can be hundreds of millions of lines of code that is intractable to change, redesign, and understanding, nor in the end is it easy to design. It also leads to code with potentially unwanted emergent properties. Today, we know how to create programs that can create programming languages. So why not write software that closely follows the problem, without a programming language, then let other programs create the programming language to support it?
