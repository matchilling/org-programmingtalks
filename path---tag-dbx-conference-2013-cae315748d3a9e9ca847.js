The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: \"We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.\" And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'\"",meta:{duration:"PT32M56S"},presenter:{name:"Bret Victor"},source:{id:"8pTEmbeENF4",provider:"youtube"},slug:"the-future-of-programming",tag:["Inspiring","Funny","DBX conference 2013"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pTEmbeENF4/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"The Future of Programming"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"dbx-conference-2013",tag:"DBX conference 2013"}}}});
