It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.",meta:{duration:"PT40M12S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"SoI0lEaUvTs",provider:"youtube"},slug:"convex-optimization-in-julia",tag:["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SoI0lEaUvTs/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Convex Optimization in Julia"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"scientific-computing",tag:"scientific computing"}}}});
