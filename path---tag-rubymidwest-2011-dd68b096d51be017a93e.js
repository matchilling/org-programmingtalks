Wishing you could create polished applications on the command line similar to git or cucumber? In my talk, I'll talk about what makes a command line application \"awesome\", and why you should care. I'll talk about what makes Ruby particularly suited to this task over mainstays like bash and Perl. We'll compare and contrast several Ruby libraries that can make even your lowliest automation script a polished, maintainable, and predictable application.",meta:{duration:"PT28M57S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"1ILEw6Qca3U",provider:"youtube"},slug:"make-awesome-command-line-apps-with-ruby-by-dave-copeland",tag:["rubymidwest2011","Ruby","CLI","Command-line Interface"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1ILEw6Qca3U/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Make awesome command line apps with ruby by Dave Copeland"}},{node:{description:"Are your methods timid? Do they constantly second-guess themselves, checking for nil values, errors, and unexpected input? Even the cleanest Ruby codebases can become littered over time with nil checks, error handling, and other interruptions which steal attention away from the essential purpose of the code. This talk will discuss strategies for writing your Ruby classes and methods in a confident, straightforward style; without sacrificing functionality or robustness. In the process, we'll cover concepts and techniques points including: The narrative style of method construction The four parts of a method Three strategies for dealing with uncertain input Massaging input with coercion and the Decorator pattern Lightweight preconditions Exterminating nils from your code The chaining and iterative styles of method construction Eliminating conditionals with the Special Case and Null Object patterns Isolating errors with the Bouncer and Checked Method patterns",meta:{duration:"PT31M24S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"T8J0j2xJFgQ",provider:"youtube"},slug:"ruby-midwest-2011-confident-code-by-avdi-grimm",tag:["rubymidwest2011","Ruby","Code"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Ruby Midwest 2011 Confident Code by Avdi Grimm"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"rubymidwest2011",tag:"rubymidwest2011"}}}});
