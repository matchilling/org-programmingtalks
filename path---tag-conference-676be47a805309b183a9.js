Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website. Once again - thank you all for creating the first edition of Atmosphere Conference and see you next year.",meta:{duration:"PT51M26S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"C4z_9F6nfS8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"atmosphere-2013-your-css-is-a-mess-jonathan-snook-shopify",tag:["atmosphere","conference","2013","allegro","allegrogroup","cisco systems","cisco","dell","akamai","akamai technologies","performance","scalability","devops","web","java","javascript","css","http","developer","programming","tdd","data","john paul","conde nast"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4z_9F6nfS8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:'Atmosphere 2013: "Your CSS is a Mess" Jonathan Snook (Shopify)'}},{node:{description:"Higgs, a JIT compiler for JavaScript written in D, was presented at DConf 2013. Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining. We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in the Higgs implementation.",meta:{duration:"PT43M57S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"FGgFMZhnXvU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-day-2-talk-2-refactoring-jit-compilation-by-maxime-chevalier-boisvert",tag:["Compiler (Software Genre)","Just In Time","optimization","javascript","compilation","jit","dconf","higgs","conference","talk","Just-in-time Compilation"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGgFMZhnXvU/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014 Day 2 Talk 2: Refactoring JIT Compilation by Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert"}},{node:{description:"Videos from DjangoCon Europe 2013 are kindly provided by Heroku, a cloud application platform -- a new way of building and deploying web apps: http://heroku.com/",meta:{duration:"PT24M31S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"LguTqd6CtOw",provider:"youtube"},slug:"djangocon-eu-2013-steven-holmes-does-your-stuff-scale",tag:["djangocon","djangocon europe","djangocon europe 2013","django","python","heroku","conference","steven holmes"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LguTqd6CtOw/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DjangoCon EU 2013: Steven Holmes - Does your stuff scale?"}},{node:{description:'Learn from John Papa\'s talk "10 AngularJS Patterns" from Code on the Beach 2014 at One Ocean Resort & Spa, Atlantic Beach, Florida.

Come learn how to build AngularJS apps that manage multiple screens, structure your application code, maintain clean code with popular patterns, implement CRUD, perform robust HTML validation, use local storage, pass unit tests, and use a automated build tasks. This session explores solutions to several of the common challenges that AngularJS developers face while building business applications."',meta:{duration:"PT1H1M27S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"UlvCbnKAH3g",provider:"youtube"},slug:"john-papa-10-angularjs-patterns-code-on-the-beach-2014",tag:["John Papa","AngularJS (Software)","Beach","JavaScript","Single Page Apps","Patterns","Code on the Beach","conference","Software Engineering (Industry)","Software Development (Industry)","Software Design Pattern (Field Of Study)","Programming Language","programming","Jacksonville (City/Town/Village)","Florida (US State)"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UlvCbnKAH3g/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"John Papa - 10 AngularJS Patterns - Code on the Beach 2014"}},{node:{description:'In my technical presentation ("The Evolution of Java: Past, Present, and Future"), I\'ll be discussing all of the changes to the Java programming language since its inception. In this this keynote, I\'ll focus my attention on the starting point: I\'ll present my candidates for the best and worst features in the platform as it was originally released (JDK 1.0), and explain the reasoning behind my choices. Some of my choices may be obvious, but others will likely surprise you. A splendid time is guaranteed for all.\n\nJosh Bloch\n\nGoogle\n\nJoshua Bloch is a software architect in the Open Source Program Office at Google, author of the bestselling, Jolt Award-winning "Effective Java" (Addison-Wesley, 2001; Second Edition, 2008), and coauthor of "Java Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases" (Addison-Wesley, 2005) and "Java Conurrency in Practice" (Addison-Wesley, 2006).
