First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \\\"Big Data\\\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\\n\\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\\nhttp://gotocon.com\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H4M52S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"BeNrVl2_nyI\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft\",\"tag\":[\"Software Engineering (Industry)\",\"Innovation (Quotation Subject)\",\"Database (Software Genre)\",\"DevOps\",\"big data\",\"pathways\",\"adrian cockcroft\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"Adrian Cockcroft\",\"Speed & Scale\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"How do we resolve the question, \\\"is this better than that?\\\" This talk discusses ideas for improving how we handle conflict in the programming community through the lens of evaluating whether Node.js is better than other technologies like Ruby.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT41M43S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"Brian Ford\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"C5fa1LZYodQ\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"is-nodejs-better\",\"tag\":[\"JSConf US 2012\",\"Node.js\",\"Ruby On Rails\",\"JavaScript\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5fa1LZYodQ/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Is Node.js Better?\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"We would like to thank everyone for attending the first edition of Atmosphere Conference, which was held on the 13th-14th May 2013 in Concordia Design in Poznan.

Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \\\"Big Data\\\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\\n\\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\\nhttp://gotocon.com\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H4M52S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"BeNrVl2_nyI\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft\",\"tag\":[\"Software Engineering (Industry)\",\"Innovation (Quotation Subject)\",\"Database (Software Genre)\",\"DevOps\",\"big data\",\"pathways\",\"adrian cockcroft\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"Adrian Cockcroft\",\"Speed & Scale\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"How do we resolve the question, \\\"is this better than that?\\\" This talk discusses ideas for improving how we handle conflict in the programming community through the lens of evaluating whether Node.js is better than other technologies like Ruby.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT41M43S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"Brian Ford\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"C5fa1LZYodQ\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"is-nodejs-better\",\"tag\":[\"JSConf US 2012\",\"Node.js\",\"Ruby On Rails\",\"JavaScript\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C5fa1LZYodQ/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Is Node.js Better?\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"We would like to thank everyone for attending the first edition of Atmosphere Conference, which was held on the 13th-14th May 2013 in Concordia Design in Poznan. Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website. Once again - thank you all for creating the first edition of Atmosphere Conference and see you next year.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT51M26S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"C4z_9F6nfS8\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"atmosphere-2013-your-css-is-a-mess-jonathan-snook-shopify\",\"tag\":[\"atmosphere\",\"conference\",\"2013\",\"allegro\",\"allegrogroup\",\"cisco systems\",\"cisco\",\"dell\",\"akamai\",\"akamai technologies\",\"performance\",\"scalability\",\"devops\",\"web\",\"java\",\"javascript\",\"css\",\"http\",\"developer\",\"programming\",\"tdd\",\"data\",\"john paul\",\"conde nast\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4z_9F6nfS8/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Atmosphere 2013: \\\"Your CSS is a Mess\\\" Jonathan Snook (Shopify)\"}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"john-papa-10-angularjs-patterns-code-on-the-beach-2014\",\"tags\":[\"John Papa\",\"AngularJS (Software)\",\"Beach\",\"JavaScript\",\"Single Page Apps\",\"Patterns\",\"Code on the Beach\",\"conference\",\"Software Engineering (Industry)\",\"Software Development (Industry)\",\"Software Design Pattern (Field Of Study)\",\"Programming Language\",\"programming\",\"Jacksonville (City/Town/Village)\",\"Florida (US State)\"]}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/talk-john-papa-10-angularjs-patterns-code-on-the-beach-2014.json\n// module id = 3041\n// module chunks = 234386917161226"],"sourceRoot":""}
