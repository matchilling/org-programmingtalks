Sometimes the best library design is based on a pattern that's very familiar to a Haskell programmer but alien to a C++ programmer. The new std::future proposal for C++17 hides several functional patterns including that of a monad -- the boogeyman of generations of imperative programmers. But once seen in action, the monad becomes just one more pattern in the toolbox of a library designer. \nBio\nBartosz Milewski always tries to be where the action is. He started as a quantum physicist when supertstrings were hot, joined the software industry to build the search engine for Microsoft Windows, became an avid proponent of object-oriented programming, and wrote a book on C++. He got into concurrency and parallelism when the multicores hit the market, and now he's evangelizing functional programming as the Holy Grail of software development.",meta:{duration:"PT1H20M59S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BFnhhPehpKw",provider:"youtube"},slug:"c17-i-see-a-monad-in-your-future",tag:["NWCPP","Bartosz Milewski","Monad","functional programming","Haskel","futures","promise","design patterns","software development","concurrent programming","parallell programming"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFnhhPehpKw/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"C++17: I See a Monad in Your Future"}},{node:{description:"Facebook's Dave Lee presents a talk about \"RACifying\" non-reactive code at the 2014 Reactive Cocoa Developer Conference hosted by GitHub.\n\nAs always, feel free to leave us a comment below and don't forget to subscribe: http://bit.ly/subgithub\n\nThanks!\n\nConnect with us.\nFacebook: http://fb.com/github\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/github\nGoogle+: http://google.com/+github\nLinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/company/github\n\nAbout GitHub\nGitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers.
