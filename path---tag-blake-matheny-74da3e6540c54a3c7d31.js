Blake draws on actual code used at Tumblr, describes their implications in a server context, and shows us where things have gone wrong and how they were corrected.\n \nThis talk will be most pertinent to engineers who build backend service applications, but should be of interest to anyone looking to find additional methods for troubleshooting code in Scala.\n\n** Visit our site for more content on Scala, including the rest of the presentations from NE Scala 2013: http://marakana.com/s/tags/scala",meta:{duration:"PT29M53S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"dCEZDlH1ygo",provider:"youtube"},slug:"concurrency-anti-patterns-in-scala",tag:["scala","blake matheny","tumblr","nescala","marakana","techtv"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dCEZDlH1ygo/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Concurrency Anti-patterns in Scala"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"blake-matheny",tag:"blake matheny"}}}});
