Basic block versioning, a novel optimization technique in early stages of testing at the time, was also introduced. Experimental results demonstratring how basic block versioning fares on multiple metrics across a variety of benchmarks can now be shown. We discuss how we have interpreted these results to inform further development of Higgs and introduce a JIT compiler architecture based on the idea of lazy/incremental compilation and inlining. We also explore how D has influenced the development of Higgs and take a more in-depth look at how various D features such as templates and CTFE are used in the Higgs implementation.",meta:{duration:"PT43M57S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"FGgFMZhnXvU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-day-2-talk-2-refactoring-jit-compilation-by-maxime-chevalier-boisvert",tag:["Compiler (Software Genre)","Just In Time","optimization","javascript","compilation","jit","dconf","higgs","conference","talk","Just-in-time Compilation"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FGgFMZhnXvU/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014 Day 2 Talk 2: Refactoring JIT Compilation by Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert"}},{node:{description:"http://dconf.org/2014/talks/bright.html",meta:{duration:"PT58M52S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"eh8WETRT7q4",provider:"youtube"},slug:"dconf-2014-high-performance-code-using-d-walter-bright",tag:["dconf","dconf2014","dlang"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eh8WETRT7q4/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"DConf 2014: High Performance Code Using D (Walter Bright)"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"dconf",tag:"dconf"}}}});
