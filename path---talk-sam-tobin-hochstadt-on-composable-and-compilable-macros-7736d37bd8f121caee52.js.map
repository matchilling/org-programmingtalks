A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars.

C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.\\n\\nIn this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas.
