Until recently Lisp even appeared doomed to fade into obscurity but several things have conspired to make Lisp somewhat cool again - one of these is Clojure, a fun modern Lisp targeting the Java Virtual Machine.\\n\\nHowever the Web doesn't speak JVM bytecodes. It speaks JavaScript - thus the cornucopia of languages that now compile to JavaScript. The most well known include GWT, CoffeeScript, and more recently Dart and TypeScript. However none of these represent a real break from the status quo.\\n\\nJohn McCarthy's insanely great idea still has a lot to offer the Web and we'll see how with ClojureScript, an implementation of Clojure that targets JavaScript.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT32M3S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":\"David Nolen\"},\"source\":{\"id\":\"MTawgp3SKy8\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"clojurescript-lisps-revenge\",\"tag\":[\"Clojure\",\"Lisp\",\"GOTO Conference\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MTawgp3SKy8/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"ClojureScript: Lisp's Revenge\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Check out our upcoming conferences at http://gotocon.com\\nSubscribe to GOTO Conference's YouTube Channel at http://www.youtube.com/user/GOTOConferences?sub_confirmation=1\\n\\nDouglas Crockford - JSON Creator & Yahoo!

The best languages are brilliant and sadly unfashionable. But we love our stylish, over-rated syntax, and this talk presents an amazing parsing technique that helps achieve it.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\\nhttp://gotocon.com\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT49M40S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"Nlqv6NtBXcA\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"syntaxation-douglas-crockford\",\"tag\":[\"Programming Language\",\"Syntaxation\",\"Douglas Crockford\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\",\"GOTO Conference\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nlqv6NtBXcA/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Syntaxation • Douglas Crockford\"}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"microservices-spotify-kevin-goldsmith\",\"tags\":[\"GOTO Conference\",\"Berlin\",\"Microservices\",\"Spotify\",\"Programming Languages\"]}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/talk-microservices-spotify-kevin-goldsmith.json\n// module id = 3083\n// module chunks = 170063128919005"],"sourceRoot":""}
