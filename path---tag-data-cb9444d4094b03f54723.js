Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website. Once again - thank you all for creating the first edition of Atmosphere Conference and see you next year.",meta:{duration:"PT51M26S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"C4z_9F6nfS8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"atmosphere-2013-your-css-is-a-mess-jonathan-snook-shopify",tag:["atmosphere","conference","2013","allegro","allegrogroup","cisco systems","cisco","dell","akamai","akamai technologies","performance","scalability","devops","web","java","javascript","css","http","developer","programming","tdd","data","john paul","conde nast"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C4z_9F6nfS8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:'Atmosphere 2013: "Your CSS is a Mess" Jonathan Snook (Shopify)'}},{node:{description:'In my technical presentation ("The Evolution of Java: Past, Present, and Future"), I\'ll be discussing all of the changes to the Java programming language since its inception. In this this keynote, I\'ll focus my attention on the starting point: I\'ll present my candidates for the best and worst features in the platform as it was originally released (JDK 1.0), and explain the reasoning behind my choices. Some of my choices may be obvious, but others will likely surprise you.
