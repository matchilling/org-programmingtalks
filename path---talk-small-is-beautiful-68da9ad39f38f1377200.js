Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.",meta:{duration:"PT1H7M3S"},presenter:{name:"Kevlin Henney"},slug:"small-is-beautiful",source:{id:"B3b4tremI5o",provider:"youtube"},tag:["GOTO Conference","Keynote","GOTO Copenhagen","Scaling","Legacy System","Simplicity"],title:"Small Is Beautiful"},allTalkJson:{edges:[{node:{description:"In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data.

Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon.\n\nBut how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples.\n\nI use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture. Developing a "modern style," however, is essential if we don\'t want to maintain newly-written 1970s and 1980s style code in 2020.\n\nThis presentation reflects my thoughts on what "Modern C++" should mean in the 2010s: a language for programming based on light-weight abstraction with direct and efficient mapping to hardware, suitable for infrastructure code.',meta:{duration:"PT1H29M48S"},presenter:{name:"Bjarne Stroustrup"},source:{id:"0iWb_qi2-uI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"keynote-goingnative-2012",tag:["C++","GoingNative","Keynote"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0iWb_qi2-uI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Keynote GoingNative 2012 C++"}},{node:{description:"This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2015\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nBrian LeRoux - PhoneGap Project Team, Adobe\n\nABSTRACT\nJavaScript has a long history of being difficult to structure and maintain.
