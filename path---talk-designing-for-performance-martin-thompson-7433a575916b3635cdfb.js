I had no idea when I started learning these arcane (guess how the "dd" command got its name) and cryptic (what about "grep"?) Unix commands how incredibly useful they would become over the next two decades. If your primary OS is Linux or OSX on the desktop, and maybe iOS or Android on the move, you\'ll find this 40-something year joke ("Unix" itself was a bad pun) has managed to embed itself into every facet of your technological life.\n\nBeing comfortable at a shell prompt and having a healthy working knowledge of Unix commands and regular expressions will give you a whole new level of capability. In this fun talk I\'ll introduce a few commands and shell tricks you should have in your back pocket, and show you how to start taking control of your operating system.

Some guidance remains unaffected by the passing of paradigms, the evolution of technology or the scaling of development: break your software into small, cohesive parts defined by clear interfaces and sound implementations, all the while striving for simplicity. The excuses for not doing so are as predictable as they are problematic. But if you want to create legacy code, make sure code is arbitrarily partitioned into large, incoherent parts characterised by unwieldy interfaces and incomprehensible implementations.\nWhile there are many definitions of what a legacy system is, common to almost all perceptions of a legacy system is the concept of size — specifically, lots of it. The phrase 'small legacy system' can be considered an oxymoron. This talk sets out to re-assess and reassert the importance of thinking and implementing small as an essential property of software systems — yes, even the large ones.",meta:{duration:"PT1H7M3S"},presenter:{name:"Kevlin Henney"},source:{id:"B3b4tremI5o",provider:"youtube"},slug:"small-is-beautiful",tag:["GOTO Conference","Keynote","GOTO Copenhagen","Scaling","Legacy System","Simplicity"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B3b4tremI5o/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Small Is Beautiful"}},{node:{description:'This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2014\nhttp://gotochgo.com\n\nAdrian Cockcroft - Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures and Former Netflix Cloud Architect Pioneer\n\nABSTRACT\nTo deliver software products at high velocity requires four things. First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured "Big Data" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com',meta:{duration:"PT1H4M52S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"BeNrVl2_nyI",provider:"youtube"},slug:"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft",tag:["Software Engineering (Industry)","Innovation (Quotation Subject)","Database (Software Genre)","DevOps","big data","pathways","adrian cockcroft","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","Adrian Cockcroft","Speed & Scale"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft"}},{node:{description:"We would like to thank everyone for attending the first edition of Atmosphere Conference, which was held on the 13th-14th May 2013 in Concordia Design in Poznan. Considering the fact that the event was organised for the first time, we must admit that there was a great number of attendees interested in web scalability and performance. Together with organisers we managed to gather over 200 people. Two tracks of lectures, interviews and thousands of conversations behind the scenes guaranteed a successful conference, which we are proud to be organisers of. We hope that this event has met your expectations and gave you a chance to exchange experience, establish cooperation and meet people with similar interests. The first edition of Atmosphere would not be possible if not a great partners' support. Main Partner was the Allegro Group, which has also helped us create the conference schedule. Gold Sponsors were Akamai Technologies and Cisco Systems, whereas Silver Sponsor was the Dell Company. We would also like to thank our media partners, online services and bloggers who helped us promote the event. Photos, presentations and videos will be available soon on the website.
