It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming, and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.

A year ago, he told us that Agile is Dead. How could this be? Why had he deserted us? And what are we to do? It turns out that while the "Agile" industry is busy debasing the meaning of the word, the underlying values are still strong. In this talk, Dave will draw a distinction, and show us how to reclaim agility for ourselves. As usual, he\'ll probably end up making some friends, and making some enemies.

We start our journey in the late 80s and our "discovery" of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession.
