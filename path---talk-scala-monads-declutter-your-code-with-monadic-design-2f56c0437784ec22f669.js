Yet we still frequently encounter situations where extracting a value from a map is not guaranteed to succeed, or mapping across a set of cases is not guaranteed to be exhaustive. With dependent types we can make operations like these completely safe by construction, in the process eliminating entire classes of errors, and furthermore we can do this without complicating user code.\n\nAdditionally, with more precise type information becoming available at compile time, we elicit the exciting opportunity to use it to optimize performance at runtime, beyond what would be possible without dependent typing.\n\nThe talk will cover several simple and intermediate examples using dependent types, and will give a brief outline of some of the the challenges involved in implementing typesafe libraries with dependent types in Scala, but the majority of the talk will be accessible to all Scala users.",meta:{duration:"PT59M28S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"26UHdZUsKkE",provider:"youtube"},slug:"minimizing-the-slippery-surface-of-failure-jon-pretty",tag:["scala"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/26UHdZUsKkE/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Minimizing the Slippery Surface of Failure â€” Jon Pretty"}},{node:{description:"I hit on some practical use cases for functors/applicatives/monads.\n\nPretty fast and quick run through of everything, but you can't learn the world in 30 min.

Sometimes the best library design is based on a pattern that's very familiar to a Haskell programmer but alien to a C++ programmer. The new std::future proposal for C++17 hides several functional patterns including that of a monad -- the boogeyman of generations of imperative programmers. But once seen in action, the monad becomes just one more pattern in the toolbox of a library designer. \nBio\nBartosz Milewski always tries to be where the action is.

It now has to share space with its younger siblings JRuby, Jython, Groovy, Clojure, Scala and many others. Each new language has its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared to Java, and its own niche in which it performs best, but Scala in particular is gaining momentum.\n\nIn this presentation to San Francisco Java User Group on January 18, 2012, Marakana's own Dan Rosen introduces Scala to Java developers and shows off some of its expressive power -- higher-order functions, type inference, and pattern matching -- by building a simple web service.

Do they constantly second-guess themselves, checking for nil values, errors, and unexpected input? Even the cleanest Ruby codebases can become littered over time with nil checks, error handling, and other interruptions which steal attention away from the essential purpose of the code. This talk will discuss strategies for writing your Ruby classes and methods in a confident, straightforward style; without sacrificing functionality or robustness. In the process, we'll cover concepts and techniques points including: The narrative style of method construction The four parts of a method Three strategies for dealing with uncertain input Massaging input with coercion and the Decorator pattern Lightweight preconditions Exterminating nils from your code The chaining and iterative styles of method construction Eliminating conditionals with the Special Case and Null Object patterns Isolating errors with the Bouncer and Checked Method patterns",meta:{duration:"PT31M24S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"T8J0j2xJFgQ",provider:"youtube"},slug:"ruby-midwest-2011-confident-code-by-avdi-grimm",tag:["rubymidwest2011","Ruby","Code"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/T8J0j2xJFgQ/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Ruby Midwest 2011 Confident Code by Avdi Grimm"}},{node:{description:"Blake Matheny approaches his talk at NEScala with a collection of trial-and-error experiences he's acquired as the VP of Engineering at Tumblr (who for the past year and half has adopted Scala as their primary backend development language).
