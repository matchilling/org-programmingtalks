This session will present to the listeners a range of concrete methods and techniques applicable in different phases of a design process, to handle specific challenges. This will include design patterns, personas, wire framing, paper prototype testing, progressive disclosure, card sorting and creative workshops and many of the methods and techniques will be accompanied by examples.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com",meta:{duration:"PT51M20S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"7OSkB4BCx00",provider:"youtube"},slug:"user-interface-ux-techniques-janne-jul-jensen",tag:["Software Development","Janne Jul Jensen","User Interface Design (Field Of Study)","User Interface (Ontology Instance)","User Interface","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","User Experience Design (Industry)","Technology (Industry)","User Interface (Speech Topic)","UX","Trifork","Design (Industry)","Programming Language","Videos for Developers"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7OSkB4BCx00/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"User Interface (UX) Techniques â€¢ Janne Jul Jensen"}},{node:{description:"Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is becoming an increasingly common way to structure event- driven code, but the term \"FRP\" actually refers to a large body of increasingly diverse work. This talk will quickly cover the basics of FRP, and then go into a couple different formulations of FRP that people are beginning to use. We will explore how these formulations fit together historically and theoretically.\nFinally, we will see how the particular variation of FRP used in Elm makes it easy to implement hot- swapping and Elm's Time Traveling Debugger.\n\nby Evan Czaplicki (@czaplic) - Prezi \n\nI am a functional programmer at heart, and my broad goal is to provide the tools and learning resources to make functional languages common in industry.

When it was introduced at JSConf US in May, the audience was shocked by some of its design principles. One sarcastic tweet from an audience member ended up describing React's philosophy quite accurately: https://twitter.com/cowboy/status/339858717451362304\n\nAt Facebook and Instagram, we're trying to push the limits of what's possible on the web with React. My talk will start with a brief introduction to the framework, and then dive into three controversial topics: Throwing out the notion of templates and building views with JavaScript, \"re-rendering\" your entire application when your data changes, and a lightweight implementation of the DOM and events.\n\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
