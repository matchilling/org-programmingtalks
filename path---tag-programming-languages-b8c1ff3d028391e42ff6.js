Published as a paper many years later, Strachey's lectures provide an especially readable overview of programming languages concepts.\n\nBio\n----\nJohn Myles White (@johnmyleswhite) is a Julia hacker who loves thinking about the ways in which the design of technical programming languages influences the way in which we think about statistics and machine learning.

It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nAstrophysicist and Software Architect Brian Beckman interviews Rich Hickey to dig into the details of this very interesting language. If you don't know much about Clojure and the general problems it aims to solve, well, watch and listen carefully to this great conversation with plenty of whiteboarding and outstanding questions. Expert to Expert simply rocks! Thank you for spending time with us, Rich! Clojure is great!",meta:{duration:"PT53M56S"},presenter:{name:"Rich Hickey and Brian Beckman"},source:{id:"wASCH_gPnDw",provider:"youtube"},slug:"expert-to-expert-rich-hickey-and-brian-beckman-inside-clojure",tag:["clojure","programming languages"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wASCH_gPnDw/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Expert to Expert: Inside Clojure"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"programming-languages",tag:"programming languages"}}}});
