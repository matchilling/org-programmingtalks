By compiling the PyPy interpreter into javascript, and retargeting its JIT compiler to emit asmjs code at runtime, it is possible to run python code in the browser at speeds competitive with a native python environment.  This talk will demonstrate the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the results that have been achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when trying to take python onto javascript's home turf.\n\nWe'll cover: an overview of PyPy and why it's a good fit for this type of project; an introduction to asmjs and the rise of javascript as a compile target; what it looks like when you smoosh these two technologies together; a comparison with other approaches such as brython; and some concrete suggestions for how the result might be useful in practice.\n\nPyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language.

HDF5 and NetCDF were designed to efficiently store the results of supercomputing applications like climate model outputs, or the data streams received from NASA's fleet of earth observing satellites. They provide a lot of optimizations concerning transparent file compression, speed of access or working with multiple files as if it were one large data set.A couple of Python libraries exist that allow fast and pythonic access to these formats.We will show you how to create and access these types of files from Python, and how to use their advanced features to tune them for maximum efficiency.Tutorial prerequisites and instructions.\n\nThomas Pfaff",meta:{duration:"PT1H19M39S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"AXlp7qxqu8E",provider:"youtube"},slug:"thomas-pfaff-advanced-data-storage",tag:["pydata","Berlin","Python","programming language","lecture","science"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AXlp7qxqu8E/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Thomas Pfaff: Advanced Data Storage"}},{node:{description:"The behavior of names and values in Python can be confusing.

Although it is easy to avoid missing points and noise to some level, it is not easy to detect wrong measurements and outliers in the dataset. These outliers may present a larger problem in time-series signals since every data point has a temporal dependency to the data point before and after. Therefore, it is crucially important to be able to detect and possibly correct these outliers. In this talk, I will introduce three different methods to be able to detect outliers in time-series signals; Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Median Filtering and Bayesian approach. http://bugra.github.io/work/notes/2014-03-31/outlier-detection-in-time-series-signals-fft-median-filtering/",meta:{duration:"PT36M30S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"t4zEeujVht8",provider:"youtube"},slug:"bugra-akyildiz-outlier-detection-in-time-series-signals",tag:["Python","Data Analysis","PyData","Time Series","Bayesian Approach"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t4zEeujVht8/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Bugra Akyildiz - Outlier Detection in Time Series Signals"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"python",tag:"Python"}}}});
