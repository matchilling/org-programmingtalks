At least, according to Michael Jackson, co-founder of HUM, it is. But stay calm! In this presentation, Michael and his co-presenter\nDomenic Denicola, Software Engineer at Lab49, will walk you through all the steps required to avoid this dark and mysterious place.\n\nInstead of simply throwing together a clunky example, and a solution to a very specific case, Michael and Domenic dive deeper into more conceptual problems. How did we get to "callback hell" and what can we do it avoid it next time? This helpful demonstration covers handy tips about Promises and strategies for building fully asynchronous APIs in JavaScript.\n\n**Follow along with Michael and Domenic\'s slides: http://mrkn.co/lb0t1',meta:{duration:"PT50M25S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"hf1T_AONQJU",provider:"youtube"},slug:"redemption-from-callback-hell",tag:["callback","callback hell","marakana","techtv","html5","html5devconf","michael jackson","michael jackson develoepr","domenic denicola","HUM","Lab49"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hf1T_AONQJU/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Redemption from Callback Hell"}},{node:{description:"Brian Lonsdorf has a love-hate relationship with Underscore.js. Yes, it offers a bunch of tools included in today's functional programming paradigm (like map, filter, reduce, take, drop, compose, etc.), but in Underscore the functions are sometimes verbose and unintuitive. It claims to be a functional programming language, but how true is that?\n\nDespite certain characteristics, Brian offers some solutions for using Underscore productively. He plays a bit of catchup for the functional programming newbie, but then dives into the denser more theoretical concepts.\n\n**Follow along with Brian's slides: http://mrkn.co/5nvjz",meta:{duration:"PT36M31S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"m3svKOdZijA",provider:"youtube"},slug:"hey-underscore-youre-doing-it-wrong",tag:["brian lonsdorf","html5","html5devconf","san francisco","Underscore","Underscore.js","functional programming","marakana","tips","tricks","use underscore.js productively"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m3svKOdZijA/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Hey Underscore, You're Doing It Wrong!"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"html5devconf",tag:"html5devconf"}}}});
