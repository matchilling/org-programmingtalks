In this talk I'll introduce you to Chicago Boss, the web framework that takes care of all the hard parts of Erlang/OTP for you, letting the developer focus on building a great website. I'll explain why Erlang is an excellent choice for delivering web content, give a high-level overview of the Chicago Boss architecture, and explicate the philosophy behind some of CB's controversial design decisions. In the process we'll cover CB's high-performance template system, its custom compiler chain and language-integrated query syntax, its unique approaches to e-mail and i18n, and everything in between. Some practical code examples will be included at the end. All levels of expertise are welcome.","meta":{"duration":"PT45M59S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"LGGo6bIuj8w","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"chicago-boss-a-web-framework-built-for-comfort-and-speed-evan-miller","tag":["Erlang","Erlang Factory","Chicago Boss","Evan Miller","Ruby on Rails","Web Framework"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LGGo6bIuj8w/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Chicago Boss: A Web Framework Built for Comfort (and Speed) - Evan Miller"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"web-framework","tag":"Web Framework"}}}
