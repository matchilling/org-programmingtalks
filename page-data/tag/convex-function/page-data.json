It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.","meta":{"duration":"PT40M12S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"SoI0lEaUvTs","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"convex-optimization-in-julia","tag":["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SoI0lEaUvTs/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Convex Optimization in Julia"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"convex-function","tag":"Convex Function"}}}
