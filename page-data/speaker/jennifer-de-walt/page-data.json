In this session, I'll cover what inspired me to take the path of self directed learning and what challenges I faced along the way. The first websites I made were simple and only used a tiny bit of html and css. By the end I was making dynamic, interactive apps. In this talk I'll present a selection of some of my favorite websites from the project which include games, toys, physics simulations, data visualizations and real time communication apps.\n\nhttps://www.jsconfar.com/","meta":{"duration":"PT22M3S"},"presenter":{"name":"Jennifer De Walt"},"source":{"id":"QaSbL4sRff8","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"how-i-learned-to-code-by-making-180-websites-in-180-days","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QaSbL4sRff8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"How I learned to Code by Making 180 websites in 180 days"}}]}},"pageContext":{"speaker":"Jennifer De Walt"}}}
