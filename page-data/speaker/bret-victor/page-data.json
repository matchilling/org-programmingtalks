The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: \"We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.\" And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'\"","meta":{"duration":"PT32M56S"},"presenter":{"name":"Bret Victor"},"source":{"id":"8pTEmbeENF4","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"the-future-of-programming","tag":["Inspiring","Funny","DBX conference 2013"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pTEmbeENF4/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"The Future of Programming"}},{"node":{"description":"Bret Victor invents tools that enable people to understand and create.

These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.\n\nLike any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.\n\nWe are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.\n\nBut the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.\n\nThis talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.","meta":{"duration":"PT56M22S"},"presenter":{"name":"Bret Victor"},"source":{"id":"agOdP2Bmieg","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"the-humane-representation-of-thought","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agOdP2Bmieg/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"The Humane Representation of Thought"}},{"node":{"description":"What if we designed a new kind of \"maker space\" ~ a space that isn't just for putting pieces together, but also for seeing and understanding a project's behavior in powerful ways?\n\n- seeing inside\n\n- seeing across time\n\n- seeing across possibilities\n\n\"I think people need to work in a space that moves them away from the kinds of non-scientific thinking that you do when you can't see what you're doing -- moves them away from blindly following recipes, from superstitions and rules of thumb -- and moves them towards deeply understanding what they're doing, inventing new things, discovering new things, contributing back to the global pool of human knowledge.","meta":{"duration":"PT15M12S"},"presenter":{"name":"Bret Victor"},"source":{"id":"klTjiXjqHrQ","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"seeing-spaces","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/klTjiXjqHrQ/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Seeing Spaces"}}]}},"pageContext":{"speaker":"Bret Victor"}}}
