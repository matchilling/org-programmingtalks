However, models and inference algorithms can be difficult to specify and implement, let alone design, validate, or optimize. Additionally, inference often appears to be intractable. Probabilistic programming is an emerging field that aims to address these challenges by formalizing modeling and inference using key ideas from probability theory, programming languages, and Turing-universal computation.\n\nThis talk will illustrate the common underlying principles of probabilistic programming using three research platforms:\n\nBayesDB, a Bayesian database that enables users to directly query the probable implications of data tables without training in statistics. It provides BQL, an SQL-like language for Bayesian data analysis, and MML, a minimal language for building generative population models by combining automatic model-building techniques with qualitative constraints and custom statistical code. BayesDB has been applied to problems such as cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites and assessing the evidence for microbial biomarkers of Kwashiorkor, a form of severe malnutrition.\n\nPicture, an imperative probabilistic language for 3D scene perception. Picture uses deep neural networks and statistical learning to invert generative models based on computer graphics. 50-line Picture programs can infer 3D models of human poses, faces, and other object classes from single images.\n\nVenture, an integrated platform that aims to be sufficiently expressive, efficient, and extensible for general-purpose use. It provides VentureScript, a language that gives users fine-grained control over both modeling and inference, and defines a common interface for integrating components written in other probabilistic languages. Recent applications include structure discovery from time-series via Gaussian processes and reflective AI techniques such as Bayesian optimization.\n\nVikash K.

We can ensure fewer mistakes enter our code base with immutability by default, no concept of null, and proven memory safety. Rust's state of the art compiler helps developers catch errors as early as possible without paying a penalty at runtime. Developers can write high level code in a modern language without sacrificing expressiveness, development time, or execution speed. We will explore how Rust's concept of Ownership is the key to providing compile-time safety. These guarantees apply even in the face of concurrency, allowing you to easily write multi-threaded programs correctly the first time. Rust 1.0 was released May 15th.

Alternatively (or additionally), we could obscure every design decision in a mess of deeply nested abstractions using the latest object-oriented programming and generic programming tricks. Then, for good measure, we might complicate our algorithms with interesting special cases. Such code is incomprehensible, unmaintainable, usually inefficient, and not uncommon.\n\nBut how do we write good code? What principles, techniques, and idioms can we exploit to make it easier to produce quality code? In this presentation, I make an argument for type-rich interfaces, compact data structures, integrated resource management and error handling, and highly-structured algorithmic code. I illustrate my ideas and guidelines with a few idiomatic code examples.\n\nI use C++11 freely. Examples include auto, general constant expressions, uniform initialization, type aliases, type safe threading, and user-defined literals. C++11 features are only just starting to appear in production compilers, so some of my suggestions are conjecture.

Imagine booting to the BEAM VM in just a few seconds with your Elixir app in control of the entire system. Nerves makes this possible while replacing the traditional plethora of Linux init scripts or systemd configuration files with a toolchain that is delightful to use. The Nerves philosophy is that you already have a powerful, concurrent language to define what the system should do at start-up time: Elixir. Together, we'll explore the principles Nerves uses to create embedded systems that control 3d printers, power unmanned areal vehicles, and more. You'll see first-hand how Nerves can support service discovery, hot code swapping, and collaboration through PubSub messages and mesh networking. Finally, we will explore the Nerves development life-cycle; from running ExTest, to deployment and hot code reloading.\n\nTalk objectives\n\n* Introduce developing embedded systems in Elixir using Nerves\n\n* Explore the Nerves development life-cycle\n\n* Demonstrate autonomous robotics using service discovery and messaging\n\n* Execute tests, create user interfaces with Phoenix, and perform hot code updates\n\nTarget audience\n\nCreating devices and systems which enhance our environment is fundamental to our nature.

When the MER mission was approved in the year 2000, JPL researchers had already demonstrated that capability on prototype rovers [1] using software written primarily in C++ on a VxWorks realtime O/S platform with shared memory. So when asked to incorporate that capability into the MER vehicles which also relied on a similar VxWorks realtime O/S, the team concluded it would be safest and most expedient to incorporate the already field-tested C++ software. But that presented a challenge, since at that point all rover FSW development was mandated to be done mainly in the C programming language.\n\nIn this talk we present some of the challenges we faced and solutions we found in deploying C++ onto the Mars Rovers. For example, dynamic allocation was initially precluded, but development of a specialized memory allocator (using the C++ \"placement new\" operator) enabled us to incorporate it safely into the flight system. We will discuss what aspects of C++ were incorporated, what simulation environments aided development, describe some of the tools used to validate system behavior, and explain how our success using C++ for the implementation of autonomous navigation on MER has influenced future FSW efforts.\n\n[1] Jeffrey Biesiadecki, Mark W.

Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols?\r\n\r\nThe answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their \"good\", expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness. The designers' desire for more functionality has made these protocols effectively unsecurable.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0-days, and will show where to look for these 0-days.

Most of good architecture and design practise is about trying to slow the rate at which software gets complicated. You can’t stop it, it’s a form of entropy. You can only slow it down and do your level best to stay on top of things.\n\nOne way to manage the mess is to maximise the likelihood that everyone knows what’s going on in the codebase. This requires two things: consistency and replaceability. Consistency implies you can make reasonable assumptions about unfamiliar parts of the application. Replaceability means you can kill code easily and replace it with something better.\n\nDan North argues that code should either be new enough that someone remembers writing it, or well-enough established that everyone knows how it works. It’s code in that awkward middle stage, between brand new and part-of-the-furniture, that gets forgotten about and starts to smell. If code is going to die it should die quickly. If it is going to stick around it should be stable.\n\nIn this talk, Dan describes a model for thinking about the age of code and argues for replaceability as a first class concern.

Adherents of competing paradigms, such as functional and object-oriented programming, often appear motivated by faith. Families of related languages, such as C, C++, Java, and C#, may arise from pressures of evolution. As designers of languages, adoption rates provide us with scientific data, but the belief that elegant designs are better is a matter of faith. This talk traces one concept, second-order quantification, from its inception in the symbolic logic of Frege through to the generic features introduced in Java 5, touching on features of faith and evolution. The remarkable correspondence between natural deduction and functional programming informed the design of type classes in Haskell. Generics in Java evolved directly from Haskell type classes, and are designed to support evolution from legacy code to generic code.

But finite state machines (FSMs) have real, practical value, and it is useful to know how to build and apply them in Clojure. For example, FSMs have long been popular to model game AIs and workflow rules, and FSMs provide the behind-the-scenes magic that powers Java's regexes and core.async's go blocks. In this talk, we'll look at two programming puzzles that, suprisingly, have very elegant solutions when looked at through the lens of FSMs, with code demonstrations using two different Clojure libraries for automata (automat and reduce-fsm), as well as loco, a Clojure constraint solver.\n\nAbout the speakers: Mark Engelberg has been an active member of the Clojure community ever since Clojure turned 1.0, and is the primary developer of math.combinatorics, math.numeric-tower, data.priority-map, ubergraph, and a co-developer of instaparse. By day, he teaches Scheme and Clojure to talented kids in the Seattle area; by night, he creates logic puzzles and games, using Clojure as his \"secret weapon\". His latest game is Code Master, a programming-themed puzzle game for kids, available exclusively at Target (and created with Clojure, of course!)\n\nAlex Engelberg was indoctrinated by his father in the ways of functional programming at a young age, and Clojure rapidly became his language of choice. He is happy to be using Clojure professionally as a software engineer at SecureOne in Seattle.

First, a culture of innovation that can see and respond to opportunities. Second, the data and analytics to evaluate alternatives. Third, a culture that can make decisions and assign resources quickly. Fourth, agile development and self service deployment. A fine grain loosely coupled architecture scales as the team size grows, a freedom and responsibility culture provides autonomy for innovation and fast decision making, unstructured \"Big Data\" analytics gets answers quickly, cloud removes the latency of resource allocation, and DevOps removes the coordination latency that slows down deployment. Traditional enterprise architectures are based on monolithic applications and relational databases. Cloud native architectures are based on buiding single function REST-based microservices that support integration across denormalized NoSQL data stores and a wide range of web services. This talk will also discuss strategies, patterns and pathways to perform a gradual migration towards cloud native.\n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4M52S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"BeNrVl2_nyI","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"speed-and-scale-how-to-get-there-adrian-cockcroft","tag":["Software Engineering (Industry)","Innovation (Quotation Subject)","Database (Software Genre)","DevOps","big data","pathways","adrian cockcroft","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","Adrian Cockcroft","Speed & Scale"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BeNrVl2_nyI/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Speed & Scale: How to get there • Adrian Cockcroft"}},{"node":{"description":"http://www.cppcon.org\n—\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nAsk a non-C++ developer what they think of C++ and they'll give the language plenty of compliments: powerful, fast, flexible, and \"the language for smart people\". But along with that you are likely to hear ugly, complicated, hard to read, and \"the language for smart people\". Is it possible to write beautiful C++? Not arcanely elegant or wickedly compact, but readable, clear, expressive - beautiful!

It helps a lot to acknowledge this and explicitly treat them as a part of your public API.

With ES6/2015, and future iterations,though, Javascript is gaining a more and more abstract and expressive syntax. To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners— is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners. As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science.

Bugs are becoming not just annoyances for software developers, but sources of potentially catastrophic failures. A careless programmer mistake could leak our social security numbers or crash our cars. While testing provides some assurance, it is difficult to test all possibilities in complex systems--and practically impossible in concurrent systems. For the critical systems in our lives, we should demand mathematical guarantees that the software behaves the way the programmer expected.\n\nA single paper influenced much of the work towards providing these mathematical guarantees. C.A.R. Hoare’s seminal 1969 paper “An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming” introduces a method of reasoning about program correctness now known as Hoare logic. In this paper, Hoare provides a technique that 1) allows programmers to express program properties and 2) allows these properties to be automatically checked. These ideas have influenced decades of research in automated reasoning about software correctness.\n\nIn this talk, I will describe the main ideas in Hoare logic, as well as the impact of these ideas. I will talk about my personal experience using Hoare logic to verify memory guarantees in an operating system. I will also discuss takeaway lessons for working programmers.\n\nBio\n----\nJean Yang (@jeanqasaur) is a final-year PhD student at MIT.

Nanopass frameworks are designed to help manage this complexity. A nanopass compiler is comprised of many single-task passes with formally defined intermediate languages. The nanopass compiler technique evolved from a methodology for teaching a compiler course at Indiana University, into a full-fledged framework, capable of implementing a replacement for the Chez Scheme compiler that runs on par with the original compiler.

As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors.\nAfter thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted.\nThis talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos.

Wait, come back! In contrast to most systems programming languages (whose semantics can be quite esoteric), the semantics of a query (given some inputs) are precisely its outcome -- rows in tables. Hence when we write a query, we directly engage with its semantics: we simply say what we mean. This makes it easy and natural to reason about whether our queries are correct: that is, whether they mean what we intended them to mean.\n\nQuery languages have traditionally been applied to a relatively narrow domains: historically, data at rest in data stores; more recently, data in motion through continuous, \"streaming\" query frameworks. Why stop here? Could query languages do for a notoriously complex domain such as distributed systems programming what they have done so successfully for data management? How would they need to evolve to become expressive enough to capture the programs that we need to write, while retaining a simple enough semantics to allow mere mortals to reason about their correctness?\n\nI will attempt to answer these questions (and raise many others) by describing a query language for distributed programming called Dedalus. Like traditional query languages, Dedalus abstracts away many of the details we typically associate with programming, making data and time first-class citizens and relegating computation to a subordinate role, characterizing how data is allowed to change as it moves through space and time. As we will see, this shift allows programmers to directly reason about distributed correctness properties such as consistency and fault-tolerance, and lays the foundations for powerful program analysis and repair tools (such as Blazes and LDFI), as well as successive generations of data-centric programming languages (including Bloom, Edelweiss and Eve).\n\nPeter Alvaro\n\nUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ\n\n@palvaro\nPeter Alvaro is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Cruz.

It wraps common patterns behind a friendly API for reading, writing, and processing data. We'll start with some fundamentals of the library and how it can enable you to work very close to raw data with ease. \n\nAfter an introduction to Okio, we will look at three libraries written with it: OkHttp, a modern HTTP client; Retrofit, a high-level HTTP wrapper; and Moshi, a brand new library for serialization. \n\nNot only are these libraries powerful on their own, but when combined their efficiency and performance dramatically increase. We'll conclude with demonstration of how to use them in your applications to great effect. \n\n- Jake Wharton\n\nAndroid developer for Square working on Square Cash.

In Idris, types are a first class language construct, meaning that they can be manipulated and computed like any other language construct. It encourages a type-driven style of development, in which programmers give types first and use interactive editing tools to derive programs. Introductory examples typically involve length-preserving operations on lists, or ordering invariants on sorting.\n\nRealistically, though, programming is not so simple: programs interact with users, communicate over networks, manipulate state, deal with erroneous input, and so on. In this talk I will show how advanced type systems allow us to express such interactions precisely, and how they support verification of stateful systems as a result.\n\nThe talk will include several examples, leading to a verified implementation of a word game (Hangman). I will show how Type-driven Development allows programmers to specify the game rules in a direct and concise style, and how it leads to an implementation, guaranteed to correctly follow the rules by typechecking.","meta":{"duration":"PT46M36S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"X36ye-1x_HQ","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"type-driven-development-in-idris-edwin-brady","tag":["Scala (Programming Language)","Idris (Programming Language)"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X36ye-1x_HQ/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Type-Driven Development in Idris — Edwin Brady"}},{"node":{"description":"Chris has been working with Drupal since 2006, and has experience of developing projects at all levels.

Even with the best intentions entropy and complexity are a fact of life in growing applications. As in many other contexts it is easier to tackle the symptoms than the cause. Systems Thinking calls this behaviour \"Shifting the Burden\" and it is more widespread than you might think. From your IDE to your automated build, from DDD’s ACLs to TDD and other TLAs, from backlogs to burn-ups, we are surrounded by props for coping with complexity. As appealing as these are, they also make us less likely to address the underlying problem of complexity itself. Dan believes you can learn to recognise these coping mechanisms for what they are, and intends to set you on the path to simplicating your programming life. \n\nLink to slides: http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-chicago-20...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotochgo\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttp://gotocon.com","meta":{"duration":"PT55M31S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"XqgwHXsQA1g","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"kicking-the-complexity-habit-dan-north","tag":["Software As A Service (Industry)","Application Software (Software Genre)","Programming Language","dan north","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","GOTO Conference","Programmer (Profession)","complexity"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XqgwHXsQA1g/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Kicking the Complexity Habit • Dan North"}},{"node":{"description":"\"Speaker: lvh\n\nA very brief introduction to the theory and practice of distributed systems.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015 and https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides\"","meta":{"duration":"PT45M25S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"YAFGQurdJ3U","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"lvh-distributed-systems-101-pycon-2015","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAFGQurdJ3U/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"lvh - Distributed Systems 101 - PyCon 2015"}},{"node":{"description":"Building a Neural Network from Scratch by Karmen Blake\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/IDEa/","meta":{"duration":"PT32M27S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"YE0h9DURSOo","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"elixirdaze-2016-learn-elixir-building-a-neural-network-from-scratch-by-karmen-blake","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YE0h9DURSOo/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"ElixirDaze 2016 - Learn Elixir: Building a Neural Network from Scratch by Karmen Blake"}},{"node":{"description":" ","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4M35S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"YScIPA8RbVE","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"the-algebra-of-algebraic-data-types","tag":["London","Haskell","Algebra","Algebraic","Types"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YScIPA8RbVE/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"The Algebra of Algebraic Data Types"}},{"node":{"description":"This is the second part of Martin Fowlers keynote at OOP 2014 in Munich and is a tricky talk to describe.

As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law.\n\nOf course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is \"the Way\".\n\nDr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9.\n\nThis video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation. Of course, you can't just cover monads in a vacuum (category theory is not really addressed here) so the context is functional programming (Brian covers functions and composable functional structures (function chains) and of course monoids and then monads).\n\nTune in.

These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.\n\nLike any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.\n\nWe are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.\n\nBut the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.\n\nThis talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.","meta":{"duration":"PT56M22S"},"presenter":{"name":"Bret Victor"},"source":{"id":"agOdP2Bmieg","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"the-humane-representation-of-thought","tag":[],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/agOdP2Bmieg/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"The Humane Representation of Thought"}},{"node":{"description":"Clojure for a desktop GUI application.

To manage this complexity and build larger applications and systems, C++ strives to form emergent structures (often found in nature, such as snowflakes' symmetrical structures), where simple patterns combine to form a remarkably complex and powerful system. These structures provide both a means to limit the complexity of each component and the essential economies of scale we rely on when developing software.\n\nFrom handheld devices to warehouse-sized data centers, motivated by smaller devices and increased concerns over power consumption, we are relying upon C++ to deliver these complex systems with unmatched efficiency. Our optimizing compilers today are more important than ever before and are utterly opaque to most practicing programmers. Compounding matters, the very emergent structures which allow C++ systems to scale for humans often provide unique and unsolved challenges to optimization.\n\nIn this talk, I will start with a brief overview of how modern optimizing compilers work with C++ code at a very high level. I will then walk through the specific structures and patterns of C++ code, which are at the core of forming emergent structures out of simple, elegant elements. I will also address how these interactions can be effectively modeled and analyzed by a compiler to produce efficient final programs. All of this will be illustrated by a collection of real world case studies, which are broadly applicable and show up throughout modern C++ code bases. My goal is to give a framework for understanding these interactions both in the C++ code and the optimizing compiler, so that programmers are aware of the implications posed by these patterns. Finally, I will introduce a set of principles and techniques for designing and implementing C++ programs and libraries to specifically clear the way for modern optimizers while retaining the simplicity of each component and the power of the combined whole.","meta":{"duration":"PT1H33M2S"},"presenter":{"name":"Chandler Carruth"},"source":{"id":"eR34r7HOU14","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"optimizing-the-emergent-structures-of-c","tag":["c++now","Boostcon","keynote"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eR34r7HOU14/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Optimizing the Emergent Structures of C++"}},{"node":{"description":"Day 1 - Contemporary computer architectures make it possible for slow code to work reasonably well.

There is a good chance it is in part because of concerns about the performance of your software. Whether they stem from needing to run on every smaller mobile devices, squeezing the last few effects into video game, or because every watt of power in your data center costs too much, C++ programmers throughout the industry have an insatiable desire for writing high performance code.\n\nUnfortunately, even with C++, this can be really challenging. Over the past twenty years processors, memory, software libraries, and even compilers have radically changed what makes C++ code fast. Even measuring the performance of your code can be a daunting task. This talk will dig into how modern processors work, what makes them fast, and how to exploit them effectively with modern C++ code. It will teach you how modern C++ optimizers see your code today, and how that is likely to change in the coming years. It will teach you how to reason better about the performance of your code, and how to write your code so that it performs better. You will even learn some tricks about how to measure the performance of your code.\n--\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs. Our goal is to give end-users the ability to create parameterized, composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers. We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people, and in particular people with artistic/visual creative style.\n\n In realizing this vision, we develop algebras for visual presentation and for \"deep\" function application, where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples, functions, etc. Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations.\n\n\nSpeaker: Conal Elliott\nMost of my research is aimed at supporting the creation of interactive synthetic media content, including computer animation, human-computer interaction, images, 2D and 3D geometry, and programmable shaders. In all cases, I aim to preserve or improve on the flexibility and performance of mainstream programming approaches, while greatly simplifying the creation process.\n\nSynthetic media programs are almost always implemented in sequential, imperative (often object-oriented) languages. My research explores use of declarative languages, resulting in much simpler and more reusable and composable programs. These languages are also more amenable to execution on parallel architectures such as modern graphics processors, because declarative languages abstract away from order of execution, removing the accidental sequentiality found in imperative programs. Even on sequential machines, declarative formulations have much simpler mathematical semantics, which facilitates automatic optimization. They also tend to be spatially and temporally continuous (resolution-independent), allowing them to adapt naturally to machines with different speeds and display resolutions.\n\nAfter exploring explicit programming of synthetic media content for several years, I'm now also keenly interested in supporting artists. The goal of my new new research agenda is to give artists access to the expressive power of computers and programming languages, while retaining an artist's working style. I mean \"artist\" in a broad sense, in contrast to the verbal and sequential style of an engineer.  (I don't mean to suggest that people fit neatly into these two categories.)

Currently, to create an interactive diagram one must write code to procedurally draw the diagram and respond appropriately to user input. Writing this code can take hours or days. Apparatus aims to reduce the time to create an interactive diagram from hours to minutes.\n\nApparatus combines the direct manipulation capabilities of a vector graphics editor with the dataflow capabilities of a spreadsheet. Through this hybridization, Apparatus supports both spatial and symbolic ways of working in tandem. Dataflow defines the state space of a diagram, algebra driving geometry. Dragging shapes moves through this state space, geometry driving algebra. Instead of function calls or object-oriented inheritance, Apparatus uses a \"call by copying\" pattern for diagram reuse. Reused diagrams do not need to be explicitly parameterized. Instead of loops, Apparatus uses spreads which allow any value to exist in a \"superposition\". This allows shapes to be looped over implicitly. By decomposing shapes into paths of points, it also enables Apparatus to plot curves.\n\nToby Schachman\nCOMMUNICATIONS DESIGN GROUP\n\nToby Schachman is an artist and interaction designer interested in new ways of seeing.

The idea never went beyond its seminal stage. In the present study I try to make it less fuzzy by relating it to the ontologically interpreted category theory, where \"ontological interpretation\" should be understood \"in the sense of Quine\". Roughly speaking, the ontology in the sense of Quine does not aspire to establish what does exist, but rather what a given theory or doctrine assumes there exists. To construct such an ontology, one should paraphrase a given doctrine into the first order logical calculus and look for those variables that are bound by the existential quantifiers. Only those entities that correspond to such variables are postulated to exist. However, in principle each topos has its own \"internal logic\". Consequently, we should apply Quine's program to each such category individually (by employing its own internal logic), and speak about the ontology in the sense of Quine characteristic for a given category in terms of a given logical calculus (if Quine's program is realisable in this logic). However, the Quine ontological program does not directly refer to the internal logic of a given theory, but rather to the logic with the help of which we are interpreting this theory (the external or meta-logic), and this is expected to be the standard classical logic. This is also the case with respect to category theory. When developing this theory, for instance by proving theorems, we are using standard logical laws of inference. This is why we seem entitled to ontologically interpret category theory strictly following Quine's recipe (i.e. with the help of the first order logical calculus), but we should be aware that this could be conditioned by the fact that our brain is a macroscopic object embedded into the world having the ontology characteristic for the category of sets. Having these caveats in mind I sketch \"ontological commitments\" of category theory and briefly signal some underlying philosophical problems.\n\n***\n\nThis talk was delivered during the conference ���The Limits of Physics and Cosmology” organized by Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies.\n\nThere exist various kinds of limits which are inherent in cosmological research and physics.\n\nThe most conspicuous one is connected with scientific method itself. It manifests itself during attempts to construct (or discover) suitable mathematical structures to model the physical world. However, this limit may be even more profound. Over the past 300 years we have become accustomed to the mathematical and empirical method which has proven to be uncannily successful in describing the enclosing universe. But is there a fundamental limit to the method itself which is intrinsic to the structure of the world?\n\nAnother group of limits which are more connected to ourselves – as human beings – are conceptual ones. The two monumental theories of physics of the 20th century – General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics - are incompatible and this inconsistency is not only on the mathematical level, but also on the conceptual. Usually scientists believe that the reconciliation between the relativist and quantum realms is possible. But is there a conceptual limit within ourselves as elements of the world?","meta":{"duration":"PT44M7S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"jjfE2jTAQrE","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"field-of-rationality-and-category-theory-michal-heller","tag":["Centrum Kopernika Badań Interdyscyplinarnych","Centrum Kopernika","Copernicus Center for Interdisciplinary Studies","Copernicus Center","Kraków","Michael Heller (Award Winner)","Category Theory (Field Of Study)","Mathematics (Field Of Study)","Physics (Field Of Study)","Theory (Quotation Subject)","Philosophy (Field Of Study)","Józef Życiński (Deceased Person)"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jjfE2jTAQrE/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Field of Rationality and Category Theory, Michał Heller"}},{"node":{"description":"JVMLS 2015 - Multi-Language Runtime - Mark Stoodley\n\nThe JVM Language Summit is an open technical collaboration among language designers, compiler writers, tool builders, runtime engineers, and VM architects.

However, it does not provide good mechanisms for manipulating combinations of those values: like a map of sequences of maps of maps. Code that aims to manipulate these nested data structures complects navigation code with the desired query or transformation. Code like this is painful to write and ugly to read.\n\nSpecter is a library that makes querying and transformation of nested data structures simple, easy, and efficient. At its core it abstracts away the concept of data structure navigation and makes these navigations highly composable. Specter can manipulate any of Clojure's maps, sequences, records, and sets, and by hooking into Specter's protocols you can use it to manipulate any data structure. On top of all this, Specter is highly performant: for example, Specter's equivalent to update-in runs 5x faster. Once you've used Specter, it's hard to imagine programming Clojure without it.\n\nNathan Marz\nRED PLANET LABS, INC.\n@nathanmarz\n\nNathan is the creator of the open source projects Apache Storm and Cascalog.

But C++ does not give you these things for free, it gives you the tools to control these things and achieve them where needed. How do you realize this potential of the language? How do you tune your C++ code and achieve the necessary performance metrics?\n\nThis talk will walk through the process of tuning C++ code from benchmarking to performance analysis. It will focus on small scale performance problems ranging from loop kernels to data structures and algorithms. It will show you how to write benchmarks that effectively measure different aspects of performance even in the face of advanced compiler optimizations and bedeviling modern CPUs. It will also show how to analyze the performance of your benchmark, understand its behavior as well as the CPUs behavior, and use a wide array of tools available to isolate and pinpoint performance problems. The tools and some processor details will be Linux and x86 specific, but the techniques and concepts should be broadly applicable.\n--\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more.

They are simple high order functions agnostic of the notion of iterator or collection and can be combined by simple function composition. They can later be applied eagerly or lazily over iterators, but most interestingly, also to other kinds of \"reactive\" sources, like networked streams, inter-process channels or reactive observables (e.g. RxCpp). Not only they provide an elegant decoupling between the \"what\" and the \"how\" and higher level of reuse, their implementation is often simpler and and more performant than similar boost::range adaptors.\n\nTransducers were introduced in Clojure by Rich Hickey. At Ableton we implemented them in C++ and released them as part of our Open Source modern C++ toolkit: Atria. Our implementation introduces innovations of its own, like implementing state-full transducers without mutation, enabling further safety and reusability. We also use Eric Niebler's technique to describe and check its concepts in standard compliant C++11.\n\nIn this session we will introduce the concept of transducers and how they can be implemented in modern C++.","meta":{"duration":"PT1H4S"},"presenter":{"name":"Juan Pedro Bolívar Puente"},"source":{"id":"vohGJjGxtJQ","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"transducers-from-clojure-to-c","tag":["Clojure","CppCon 2015"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vohGJjGxtJQ/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Transducers: from Clojure to C++"}},{"node":{"description":"Over the last decade or so, Refactoring has become a widely used technique to keep a high internal quality for a codebase.

It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nAstrophysicist and Software Architect Brian Beckman interviews Rich Hickey to dig into the details of this very interesting language. If you don't know much about Clojure and the general problems it aims to solve, well, watch and listen carefully to this great conversation with plenty of whiteboarding and outstanding questions.

And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming.

Sadly, this means we're all basically stuck in an abusive relationship with JavaScript. Obviously not a desirable position to find ourselves in, we've tried breaking out of the JS trap in a variety of ways: JS dialects (solving no design flaws but at least looking prettier) and JS as a compilation target (resulting, mostly, in unappealingly large output to support the emulated runtimes).\nSo when I found myself having to build a system with real deliverable size constraints, my only options seemed to be JS itself, or TypeScript, which doesn't add much to JS but at least provides a modicum of type checking. After a few months of fighting TypeScript, though, I'd had enough. Happily, my frustration coincided with the advent of PureScript.\nAt first glance, PureScript looks and feels like Haskell, but there's hardly any extraneous machinery. The PureScript compiler generates very concise JS, and the language itself is designed with the platform's constraints in mind. Yet it offers things like higher kinded polymorphism, type classes and similar deep Haskell magic. More appealingly, it comes with a growing number of libraries for coping with the browser as a platform: functional DOM manipulation, reactive programming, and more.\nIt turned out to be a delight, getting out of my tangled mess of JavaScript and rebuilding it all in PureScript, and I'd like to show you how and why. \n\nby Bodil Stokke (@bodil) - Future Ad Labs\n\nBodil is a compulsive conference speaker in the fields of functional programming and internets technologies, and is a co-organiser of multiple developer conferences in Scandinavia and the UK, mostly because she's still learning how to stop.
