It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a number of external packages through Julia's built-in package manager at a rapid pace.","meta":{"duration":"PT40M12S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"convex-optimization-in-julia","source":{"id":"SoI0lEaUvTs","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"],"title":"Convex Optimization in Julia"},"allTalkJson":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"convex-optimization-in-julia","tags":["julialang","technical computing","scientific computing","Convex Optimization","Convex Function","Mathematical Optimization (Field Of Study)"]}}}
