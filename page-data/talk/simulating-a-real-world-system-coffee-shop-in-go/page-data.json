Many of the patterns we use in developing concurrent code mirror structures in real-world systems. In this talk, Sameer presents a simulation of a small real world system and shows how variations in the design impact the system's performance.","meta":{"duration":"PT17M36S"},"presenter":{"name":"Sameer Ajmani"},"slug":"simulating-a-real-world-system-coffee-shop-in-go","source":{"id":"jJS6G7irZSc","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["golang"],"title":"Simulating A Real-World System (Coffee Shop) In Go"},"allTalkJson":{"edges":[{"node":{"description":"Go is a new open-source programming language with an emphasis on simplicity, comprehensibility, and efficiency. It has the speed and safety of a statically-typed language and the lightweight feel of a scripting language. It has a simple feature set that is easy to understand and powerful to use, including a novel type system and concurrent programming primitives. This talk will dive into some real-world Go programs and discuss the Go idiom used in each.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software.","meta":{"duration":"PT59M20S"},"presenter":{"name":"Andrew Gerrand"},"source":{"id":"2-pPAvqyluI","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"golang-practical-go-programming","tag":["golang","FOSDEM 2011"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2-pPAvqyluI/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"golang, practical Go Programming"}},{"node":{"description":"They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but what about a gopher? \n\nIn this talk we'll investigate a bunch of odd corners of the language, libraries, and tools that even seasoned Go programmers might not know.","meta":{"duration":"PT53M11S"},"presenter":{"name":"Andrew Gerrand"},"source":{"id":"UECh7X07m6E","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"stupid-gopher-tricks","tag":["golang","Golang UK Conference 2015"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UECh7X07m6E/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Stupid Gopher Tricks"}},{"node":{"description":"With projects like Openshift 3, Google Kubernetes, and Docker written in the go programming language (golang), it's important to understand what that entails.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about what it's like to work with the golang every day.\n\nWe'll share:\n\nLessons we've learned.\nBenefits and drawbacks of the language.\nThe challenges and rewards of using golang.\nFundamental and advanced uses of the language.\nDevelopment and operational uses of golang.","meta":{"duration":"PT48M32S"},"presenter":{"name":"Vincent Batts"},"source":{"id":"cMYhGNofHA4","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"golang-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly","tag":["DevNation 2015","golang","docker","Kubernetes"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cMYhGNofHA4/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Golang: The good, the bad, & the ugly"}},{"node":{"description":"In this talk Francesc Campoy Flores presents Go for Pythonistas.\n\nSlides are available at http://talks.golang.org/2013/go4python.slide\n\nHe looks at the similarities and differences between Python and Go, skipping the basics and focusing on some advanced, in-depth topics.\nPlus, we'll get our hands dirty with some Go exercises.\n\nIt displays some techniques typical from dynamic languages as generators, decorators, and monkey patching and how they can be implemented in Go.","meta":{"duration":"PT51M17S"},"presenter":{"name":"Francesc Campoy Flores"},"source":{"id":"elu0VpLzJL8","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"go-for-pythonistas","tag":["golang","python"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/elu0VpLzJL8/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Go for Pythonistas"}},{"node":{"description":"Go is the language of the cloud.
