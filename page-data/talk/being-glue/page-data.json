Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing?\n\nIn this session I'm going to share some lessons I learnt the hard way while managing my career as a Java developer. I'm going to tell you secrets that others don't want to share.

In this lecture, Richard Hamming shares his observations on “why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?’’ Some of the key ideas include courage, luck, drive (“knowledge and productivity are like compound interest”), a focus on important problems (“If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work”), open doors, selling the work (“I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others”), and much more.
