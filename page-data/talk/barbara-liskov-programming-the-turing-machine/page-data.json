Jobs shares his professional vision and personal anecdotes, from his role at the time as president and CEO of NeXT Computer Corporation, to the thrilling challenges of co-creating Apple Computer, and subsequent disappointments at his ousting. In conversational exchanges with audience members Jobs underscores the value of direct experience in the field, and “developing scar tissue.” The unexpected guest lecture within the Sloan Distinguished Speaker Series came about through the efforts of a Sloan MBA ’92 student whose sister had recently married Jobs.","meta":{"duration":"PT1H12M54S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"Gk-9Fd2mEnI","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"steve-jobs-professional-vision-and-personal-anecdotes","tag":["MIT","steve jobs","next computer","apple","bill gates"],"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Gk-9Fd2mEnI/default.jpg","height":90,"width":120}},"title":"Steve Jobs professional vision and personal anecdotes"}},{"node":{"description":"Talk by ACM A.M. Turing Laureate Dana S. Scott during the ACM A.M. Turing Centenary Celebration, June, 2012.\n\nAbstract:\n\nA very fast development in the early 1930s, following Hilbert's codification of Mathematical Logic, led to the Incompleteness Theorems, Computable Functions, Undecidability Theorems, and the general formulation of recursive Function Theory. The so-called Lambda Calculus played a key role. The history of these developments will be traced, and the much later place of Lambda Calculus in Mathematics and Programming-Language Theory will be outlined.","meta":{"duration":"PT30M8S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"source":{"id":"SphBW9ILVPU","provider":"youtube"},"slug":"lambda-calculus-then-and-now","tag":["Calculus","Dana S.
