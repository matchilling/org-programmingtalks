    "Droidcon had its first Canadian edition on April 9-10, 2015 in Montreal. \nIt was organized by Mirego http://www.mirego.com/en \n\nWe had Jake Wharton telling us more about some Ok Libraries at Droidcon Montreal.\n\nA Few \"OK\" Libraries:\nThis talk will be an in-depth look at Okio—a tiny library for interacting with bytes—and a few of the libraries written on top of it: OkHttp, Retrofit, and a newcomer named Moshi. \n\nOkio evolved naturally inside of OkHttp before being split out into its own library. It wraps common patterns behind a friendly API for reading, writing, and processing data. We'll start with some fundamentals of the library and how it can enable you to work very close to raw data with ease. \n\nAfter an introduction to Okio, we will look at three libraries written with it: OkHttp, a modern HTTP client; Retrofit, a high-level HTTP wrapper; and Moshi, a brand new library for serialization. \n\nNot only are these libraries powerful on their own, but when combined their efficiency and performance dramatically increase. We'll conclude with demonstration of how to use them in your applications to great effect. \n\n- Jake Wharton\n\nAndroid developer for Square working on Square Cash. Has a long-time severe allergy to boilerplate code and for years has been raising awareness on the issue as well as leading efforts to eradicate this horrible disease that plagues modern developers.",
