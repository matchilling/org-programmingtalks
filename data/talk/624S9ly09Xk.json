    "Cybercriminals are often perceived as having super powers to get into your systems and steal your money and data. The vast majority are just following simple cookbook recipes to take advantage of laziness, sloppiness and an failure to understand what might be risky behaviour. Defences against cybercrime do not have to be hi-tech or even very complex.\nThis talk discusses various types of cybercrime and gives some practical advice as to how to make yourself a little safer.",
