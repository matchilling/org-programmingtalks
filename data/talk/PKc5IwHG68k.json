  "description": "Java is no longer alone on the JVM. It now has to share space with its younger siblings JRuby, Jython, Groovy, Clojure, Scala and many others. Each new language has its own set of advantages and disadvantages compared to Java, and its own niche in which it performs best, but Scala in particular is gaining momentum.\n\nIn this presentation to San Francisco Java User Group on January 18, 2012, Marakana's own Dan Rosen introduces Scala to Java developers and shows off some of its expressive power -- higher-order functions, type inference, and pattern matching -- by building a simple web service. You'll never look at Java the same way.\n\nSlides from this presentation available here http://bit.ly/ztgVxa",
