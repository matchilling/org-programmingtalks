  "description": "Slides: https://github.com/asolove/jsconf-2013-slides\nDescription: Constraint programming is a paradigm that lets programmers specify the relationships between different variables, and then maintain those relationships even as the user toys with each variable. Cassowary is a fast constraint solver which now powers auto layout in iOS applications. The JavaScript port of Cassowary brings fast constraint programming to the browser.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to constraint programming, a walkthrough of the JavaScript Cassowary library, and an implementation of several \"how the heck did you do that\" programs with constraints.",
