    "Dave Thomas was one of the creators of the Agile Manifesto. A year ago, he told us that Agile is Dead. How could this be? Why had he deserted us? And what are we to do? It turns out that while the \"Agile\" industry is busy debasing the meaning of the word, the underlying values are still strong. In this talk, Dave will draw a distinction, and show us how to reclaim agility for ourselves. As usual, he'll probably end up making some friends, and making some enemies. Which will you be?",
