  "description": "The Scala standard library includes a large set of collections that covers a wide variety of use cases. For example, it offers both mutable and immutable collections, sequential and parallel collections, strict and lazy collections, and many combinations thereof.\n\nAlthough the standard collections library is widely used and works quite well today, this talk asks the question: how could the standard collections library be made better? We will look at various directions the Scala library could potentially evolve in the future, and discuss design trade-offs and migration strategies.",
