    "If you don't know your work/span from your fork/join, this talk is for you! By attending this introduction to \"thinking parallel,\" you'll learn why parallel programming matters, how to think about performance, and how to tackle real-world concerns. You'll learn about how the fork/join framework embodies best practices. And of course, you'll learn how Clojure implements these ideas with reducers.",
