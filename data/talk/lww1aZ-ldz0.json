    "I'm a language nut. I love trying them out, and I love thinking about their design and implementation. (I know, it's sad.) I came across Ruby in 1998 because I was an avid reader of comp.lang.misc (ask your parents). I downloaded it, compiled it, and fell in love. As with any time you fall in love, it's difficult to explain why. It just worked the way I work, and it had enough depth to keep me interested. Fast forward 15 years. All that time I'd been looking for something new that gave me the same feeling. Then I came across Elixir, a language by Jos√© Valim, that puts a humane, Ruby-like syntax on the Erlang VM. Now I'm dangerous. I want other people to see just how great this is. I want to evangelize. So come along and let me show you the things that I think make Elixir a serious alternative for writing highly reliable, scalable, and performant server code. And, more important, let me show you some fun stuff.",
