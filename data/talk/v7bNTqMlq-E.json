  "description": "Many people have experienced using Agile approaches within teams to deliver more working software, but what can be learnt from combing these approaches with Product Development?\n\nThis talk will cover the top seven hard-earned tips I learnt from several years spent as a Senior Product Manger for BBC Worldwide. Ever wondered how you could influence the product you were building? How can you use Agile approaches to learn about what the right product to build is? How do you overcome defensiveness?
