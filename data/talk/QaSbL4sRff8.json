  "description": "With no real coding experience, I decided to sit down and teach myself to code by making one website a day, every day, for 180 days. In this session, I'll cover what inspired me to take the path of self directed learning and what challenges I faced along the way. The first websites I made were simple and only used a tiny bit of html and css. By the end I was making dynamic, interactive apps. In this talk I'll present a selection of some of my favorite websites from the project which include games, toys, physics simulations, data visualizations and real time communication apps.\n\nhttps://www.jsconfar.com/",
