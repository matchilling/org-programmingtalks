    "The new Core.Async library in Clojure opens a realm of new possibilities for users of the language. This talk will start with an overview of Core.Async, and then show several examples ported from other CSP languages, such as Go and JSCP. The talk will end with a example program that runs on both Clojure and ClojureScript, leveraging this new library.\n\nTimothy is a polyglot programmer with a passion for compilers and fast code. He is the author of clojure-py, Mjolnir, and several other compiler and interpreter related projects. He is an employee of Relevance Inc., and loves to discuss new programming concepts and ideas with anyone who will listen.",
