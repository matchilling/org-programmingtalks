  "description": "Tired of maintaining your one-off script that has now become someone's job to execute? Wishing you could create polished applications on the command line similar to git or cucumber? In my talk, I'll talk about what makes a command line application \"awesome\", and why you should care. I'll talk about what makes Ruby particularly suited to this task over mainstays like bash and Perl.
