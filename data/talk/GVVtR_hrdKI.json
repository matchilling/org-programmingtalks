  "description": "\"Speaker: Andrew T. Baker\n\nDocker was one of last yearâ€™s most talked about open source projects - but what is it? And what does it mean for deploying applications? This talk will explain what Docker is and where it fits in with other deployment techniques. Attendees will learn the fundamentals of Docker, see some practical examples of how Docker is used, and consider if Docker could be a useful addition to their platform.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015 and https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides\"",
