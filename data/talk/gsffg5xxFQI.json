    "Many people are quick to dismiss ClojureScript as a web development language. \"It has some neat ideas\", they might say, \"but it's easier to just use JavaScript for all that\". Or perhaps \"it's fine for startups, but you'll never build a real team around it\".\n\nThis talk will discuss the many reasons why ClojureScript is in fact a very pragmatic language to consider for web development. It will discuss recent improvements, some of the not-so-obvious benefits, and use cases where ClojureScript shines.\n\nAbout the speaker: Derek Slager is a Director of Engineering for platform systems at IMS Health. He's been building web-based applications since the dot com era, and enjoys building and speaking about large scale systems, browser-based or otherwise.",
