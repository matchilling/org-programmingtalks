  "description": "What if we designed a new kind of \"maker space\" ~ a space that isn't just for putting pieces together, but also for seeing and understanding a project's behavior in powerful ways?\n\n- seeing inside\n\n- seeing across time\n\n- seeing across possibilities\n\n\"I think people need to work in a space that moves them away from the kinds of non-scientific thinking that you do when you can't see what you're doing -- moves them away from blindly following recipes, from superstitions and rules of thumb -- and moves them towards deeply understanding what they're doing, inventing new things, discovering new things, contributing back to the global pool of human knowledge.",
