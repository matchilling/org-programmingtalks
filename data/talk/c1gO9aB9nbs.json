  "description": "http://www.cppcon.org\nâ€”\nPresentation Slides, PDFs, Source Code and other presenter materials are available at: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014\n--\nExample-driven talk on how to design and write lock-free algorithms and data structures using C++ atomic -- something that can look deceptively simple, but contains very deep topics. (Important note: This is not the same as my \"atomic Weapons\" talk; that talk was about the \"what they are and why\" of the C++ memory model and atomics, and did not cover how to actually use atomics to implement highly concurrent algorithms and data structures.)\n--\nHerb Sutter: Author, chair of the ISO C++ committee, software architect at Microsoft.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com",
