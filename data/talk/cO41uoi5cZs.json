Published as a paper many years later, Strachey's lectures provide an especially readable overview of programming languages concepts.\n\nBio\n----\nJohn Myles White (@johnmyleswhite) is a Julia hacker who loves thinking about the ways in which the design of technical programming languages influences the way in which we think about statistics and machine learning. He's written two books about machine learning for O'Reilly and works at Facebook.",
