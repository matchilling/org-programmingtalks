  "description": "Does the Continuum Hypothesis have an answer? This question is pointed out by professor W. Hugh Woodin. He admits that 15 years ago he thought it was false. Has his opinion changed? You can see from this lecture.\n\nWilliam Hugh Woodin is an American mathematician and set theorist at Harvard University. He has made many notable contributions to the theory of inner models and determinacy. A type of large cardinal, the Woodin cardinal, bears his name.",
