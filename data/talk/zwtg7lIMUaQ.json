    "Weâ€™ve come a long way in the last 20 years. We start our journey in the late 80s and our \"discovery\" of design principles such as The Open Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle. In the middle 90s, we discovered that these principle led to repeating patterns of design. We gave those patterns names such as Visitor and Decorator. At the turn of the millennium we found that the benefits gained from the principles and patterns could be amplified by combining them with practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration. And now, as the decade is coming to a close, we have found that these principles, patterns, and practices have driven us to define a true profession. What will that profession require of us, and who among us can truly claim to be professional?",
