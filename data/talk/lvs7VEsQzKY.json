  "description": "Some teams are orders of magnitude more effective than others, turning around business solutions in days or even hours. Their secret is a combination of smart technology choices, great development habits and a powerful team dynamic. In this talk Dan describes a number of patterns of behaviour that he's identified working with some great teams, beyond the basics of co-location, stand-ups and pair rotation. You'll gain a new appreciation for old techniques like code reviews, and even working in silos won't seem so bad!",
