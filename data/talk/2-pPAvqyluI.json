    "Go is a new open-source programming language with an emphasis on simplicity, comprehensibility, and efficiency. It has the speed and safety of a statically-typed language and the lightweight feel of a scripting language. It has a simple feature set that is easy to understand and powerful to use, including a novel type system and concurrent programming primitives. This talk will dive into some real-world Go programs and discuss the Go idiom used in each.\r\n\r\nFOSDEM (Free and Open Source Development European Meeting) is a European event centered around Free and Open Source software development. It is aimed at developers and all interested in the Free and Open Source news in the world. Its goals are to enable developers to meet and to promote the awareness and use of free and open source software.",
