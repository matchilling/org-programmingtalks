    "Writing operating systems sounds like it's only for wizards, but it turns out that operating systems are written by humans like you and me. I'm going to tell you what a kernel is and why you should care. Then we'll talk about a few concrete ways to get started with kernel hacking, ranging from the super-easy to the terrifyingly difficult.\n\nby Julia Evans (@b0rk) - Stripe\n\nJulia Evans loves taking apart systems to find how they work, making Serious Computer Programs do silly things, and organizing outreach events to make our developer communities a better place. She works on Stripe's data team.",
