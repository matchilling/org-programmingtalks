All living organisms information systems are based on chemical processes. What can we learn by using this metaphor of chemistry in our programming? We will answer this question by looking at Artificial Chemical Computing. Building programs based on molecules and chemical reactions, we will explore new ways of thinking and opening ourselves up to innovation. We will discuss the basics of Chemical Programming and even touch on High Order Chemical Programming as well. Code examples will be in the powerful, elegant, and interactive programming language of Clojure, but you will not need to be an expert in the language to enjoy the demos. Come and join us for this adventure in looking at the programming world from a different perspective.\n\nCarin Meier\nCOGNITECT\n@gigasquid\n\nCarin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since.
