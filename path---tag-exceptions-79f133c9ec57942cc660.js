Unfortunately, many C++ developers are stuck using old C++ compilers, runtimes, and tools. They are missing out on some of the best features the language has to offer. LLVM is an open source project that can help address this, but even so it seems nearly impossible to address this growing gap between what C++ could be and what in practice it is today. This talk will explore these problems and what (if any) solutions might exist. Also, there might be some live demo. About the speaker: Chandler Carruth leads the LLVM and C++ teams at Google, building better compilers, libraries, tools, and more. He is an active contributor to the LLVM open source project, and sits on the board of directors for both the LLVM Foundation and the Standard C++ Foundation. Previously at Google, he worked on several pieces of Google’s distributed build system and helped maintain a few core C++ libraries within Google’s codebase. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University, but disavows all knowledge of the contents of his Master’s thesis. He is regularly found drinking Cherry Coke Zero in the daytime and pontificating over a single malt scotch in the evening.",meta:{duration:"PT1H23M18S"},presenter:{name:"Jason Turner"},source:{id:"OkgvqjJzH_Y",provider:"youtube"},slug:"rethinking-exceptions",tag:["C++","Exceptions","Pacific++"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OkgvqjJzH_Y/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"Rethinking Exceptions"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"exceptions",tag:"Exceptions"}}}});
