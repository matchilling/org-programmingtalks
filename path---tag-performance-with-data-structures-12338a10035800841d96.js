There is a good chance it is in part because of concerns about the performance of your software. Whether they stem from needing to run on every smaller mobile devices, squeezing the last few effects into video game, or because every watt of power in your data center costs too much, C++ programmers throughout the industry have an insatiable desire for writing high performance code.\n\nUnfortunately, even with C++, this can be really challenging. Over the past twenty years processors, memory, software libraries, and even compilers have radically changed what makes C++ code fast. Even measuring the performance of your code can be a daunting task. This talk will dig into how modern processors work, what makes them fast, and how to exploit them effectively with modern C++ code. It will teach you how modern C++ optimizers see your code today, and how that is likely to change in the coming years. It will teach you how to reason better about the performance of your code, and how to write your code so that it performs better. You will even learn some tricks about how to measure the performance of your code.\n--\nChandler Carruth leads the Clang team at Google, building better diagnostics, tools, and more. Previously, he worked on several pieces of Google’s distributed build system. He makes guest appearances helping to maintain a few core C++ libraries across Google’s codebase, and is active in the LLVM and Clang open source communities. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University, but disavows all knowledge of the contents of his Master’s thesis. He is regularly found drinking Cherry Coke Zero in the daytime and pontificating over a single malt scotch in the evening.\n--\nVideos Filmed & Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com",meta:{duration:"PT1H13M41S"},presenter:{name:null},source:{id:"fHNmRkzxHWs",provider:"youtube"},slug:"cppcon-2014-chandler-carruth-efficiency-with-algorithms-performance-with-data-structures",tag:["CppCon 2014","Chandler Carruth","Efficiency with Algorithms","Performance with Data Structures","Bash Films"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fHNmRkzxHWs/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:'CppCon 2014: Chandler Carruth "Efficiency with Algorithms, Performance with Data Structures"'}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"performance-with-data-structures",tag:"Performance with Data Structures"}}}});
