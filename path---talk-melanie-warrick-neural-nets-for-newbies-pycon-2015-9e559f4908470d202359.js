This talk breaks down the neural net structure as simply as possible, so you have a framework on which to grow your knowledge in the space. I will put neural nets in the context of real-world applications and share Python packages and code where you can get started building your own. Coming out this talk you won\'t know everything about neural nets, but you will walk away with a solid foundation and some resources on where to go next to learn more.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015 and https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides"',meta:{duration:"PT30M57S"},presenter:{name:null},slug:"melanie-warrick-neural-nets-for-newbies-pycon-2015",source:{id:"g-BJSl4zV_g",provider:"youtube"},tag:[],title:"Melanie Warrick - Neural Nets for Newbies - PyCon 2015"},allTalkJson:null},pathContext:{slug:"melanie-warrick-neural-nets-for-newbies-pycon-2015",tags:[]}}}});
