JavaScript?! Why on earth would you make robots with JavaScript?\"\n\nIt's a fair question, and one worthy of more than a hand-wavy answer about how it's cool... or something.\n\nIn this talk, let's discuss why, of all the languages on the planet, JavaScript is the perfect starting point for a future of robotics.\n\nAs a roboticist-turned-web-developer, I will provide some deep insights not only into the world of robotics, but also into JavaScript and its server-side cousin, Node.js. We'll talk about what JavaScript-enabled robots can already do, what they can't do yet, and what they might be able to do with a bit of elbow grease.\n\nAnd, if the demo deities are with us, we may even have a robot assistant on hand.\n\nRaquel Vélez\nNPM, INC.\n@rockbot\n\nRaquel Vélez is a Senior Software Developer at npm, Inc. in Oakland, CA.

When he’s not working at Heroku, he runs PlayfulJS, a website of cool JavaScript code snippets.\n\nOne of the better well-known demos on PlayfulJS is a re-creation of the Doom rendering engine in JavaScript. After building this, Hunter was contacted by Warp records about building a first-person shooter in JavaScript.\n\nOne of the issues with this request was the timeframe — three weeks to build the game to coincide with an album release, and with a tiny budget. On top of that, the game had to work on desktop, Android, and iOS. So, Hunter rationalized and decided to accept the project.\n\nAfter accepting the project for what he thought would be a small, indie release, Hunter realized that the artist (Rustie) was huge in the UK and overseas, and this release would be a huge deal.\n\nJavaScript Training from NewCircle: http://crcl.to/72rru\n\nhttp://forwardjs.com/",meta:{duration:"PT29M34S"},presenter:{name:"Hunter Loftis"},source:{id:"avwDj3KRuLc",provider:"youtube"},slug:"we-will-all-be-game-programmers",tag:["Node.js","Heroku","ForwardJS","JavaScript","PlayfulJS","Doom","video games","Game Engine"],thumbnails:{default:{url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/avwDj3KRuLc/default.jpg",height:90,width:120}},title:"We Will All Be Game Programmers"}},{node:{description:"Large Scale JavaScript Application Architecture  \nTime: Wednesday @ 10:40am | Room E-131\nhttp://html5devconf.com/index.html     #HTML5DevConf\n\nLearn how to build your team and technology without losing development time.
