Nanopass frameworks are designed to help manage this complexity. A nanopass compiler is comprised of many single-task passes with formally defined intermediate languages. The nanopass compiler technique evolved from a methodology for teaching a compiler course at Indiana University, into a full-fledged framework, capable of implementing a replacement for the Chez Scheme compiler that runs on par with the original compiler. This talk will discuss the idea of a nanopass compiler and the implementation of a simple language using the framework in Chez Scheme, along with the challenges and opportunities of using these techniques in Clojure.\\n\\nAndy is a postdoc at the University of Utah, currently working on malware detection in Android Apps, using both Scala and miniKanren to write abstract analyzers in Matt Might's lab.

It has been applied to a wide range of problems spanning several areas of science, engineering, and the arts, in many cases equaling or exceeding human performance.\\n\\nGenetic programming's roots are in Lisp, making Clojure a natural choice for modern genetic programming research and development. In this talk I will show how a simple genetic programming system can be written in about 100 lines of Clojure code, how a mature genetic programming system (PushGP) implemented in Clojure can improve the state of the art in automatic programming, and how genetic programming can be incorporated into an artificial life environment implemented in Clojure and Quil.\\n\\nAbout the speaker: Lee Spector is a Professor of Computer Science in the School of Cognitive Science at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and an adjunct professor of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. His areas of teaching and research include genetic and evolutionary computation, quantum computation, and a variety of intersections between computer science, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and the arts. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines (published by Springer) and a member of the editorial board of Evolutionary Computation (published by MIT Press). He is also a member of the SIGEVO executive committee and he was named a Fellow of the International Society for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation. \\n\\nMore details: http://hampshire.edu/lspector Resume: http://hampshire.edu/lspector/spector-resume.pdf\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT40M8S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"HWMJdO4klIE\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"genetic-programming-in-clojure-lee-spector\",\"tag\":[\"clojure\",\"Genetic Programming\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HWMJdO4klIE/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Genetic Programming in Clojure - Lee Spector\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Contemporary compilers are among the most complex of software systems, typically being required to handle sophisticated high-level source languages, generate efficient code for multiple hardware architectures and operating systems, and support source-level debuggers, profilers, and other program development tools. Nanopass frameworks are designed to help manage this complexity. A nanopass compiler is comprised of many single-task passes with formally defined intermediate languages. The nanopass compiler technique evolved from a methodology for teaching a compiler course at Indiana University, into a full-fledged framework, capable of implementing a replacement for the Chez Scheme compiler that runs on par with the original compiler. This talk will discuss the idea of a nanopass compiler and the implementation of a simple language using the framework in Chez Scheme, along with the challenges and opportunities of using these techniques in Clojure.\\n\\nAndy is a postdoc at the University of Utah, currently working on malware detection in Android Apps, using both Scala and miniKanren to write abstract analyzers in Matt Might's lab. Andy completed his Ph.D. at Indiana University, defending his dissertation, \\\"A Nanopass Framework for Commercial Compiler Development\\\", in December 2012 and will be presenting a paper related to this work at this year's International Conference on Functional Programming. This project focused on replacing Chez Scheme's compiler with a nanopass compiler, along with his adviser R. Kent Dybvig. Before returning to graduate school in 2007, Andy worked in industry as a web developer, first for the consulting firms Razorfish and Gotham Broadband, along with some independent consulting work for Viacom, and later worked full time at Teach For America, maintaining both front-end and back-end web applications.\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT40M48S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"Os7FE3J-U5Q\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"andy-keep-writing-a-nanopass-compiler\",\"tag\":[\"clojure\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Os7FE3J-U5Q/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Andy Keep - Writing a Nanopass Compiler\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"This presentation will introduce a new start-up focused on machine learning that is using Clojure.

As such, neither the traditional tools of analytics (R, Mathematica, Matlab) nor mainstreams languages (Java, C++, C#) supply its requirements well as they cannot simultaneously provide the mathematical abstractions and real-word platform power that are required.

This approach connects you in a profoundly direct way to the work, your effort to the result. This changed with the rise of machine tools, which made production more efficient but also altered what's made and how we think about making it in in a profound way. This talk explores the effects of automation on our work, which is as relevant to software as it is to furniture, especially now that once again, with Clojure, we are building things using a small set of simple tools.\\n\\nTim Ewald designs and builds software systems.
